This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

Herodias has filled the cup of the Tetrarch.

with blue dust?

of Samothrace, and is purple like the cloak of Caesar.

as red as blood. 

THE IIUBIAN 

The gods of my country are very fond. Twice 
in the year we sacrifice to them youn j^ men and maid- 
ens; fiftv young men and a hundred mudens. But 
I am afraid that we never give them quite enough, 
for they are very harsh to us.

In my country there are no gods left. The Bo-

say th^t they have hidden themselves in the moun- 
tains, but I do not believe it. Three nights I have 
been on the mountains seeking them everywhere. I 
did not find them. And at last I called them by their 
names, and they did not come. I think they are dead. 

mtST SOLDIEa

No one can tell how God worketh. His ways are

evil are good, and that the things which we call good 
are evil. There is no knowledge of any thing. We 
can but bow our heads to His will, for God is very 
strong. He breaketh in pieces the strong together 
with the weak, for He regardeth not any man.

censer that scattered strange perfumes, and when I 
looked on thee I heard a strange music. Ah I where- 
fore didst thou not look at me, Jokanaan? With the 
cloak of thine hands and with the cloak of thy blas-

upon thine eyes the covering of him who would see

but me, me, thou didst never see. If thou hadst seen 
me thou hadst loved me. I saw thee, and I loved thee. 
Oh, how I loved theel I love thee yet, Jokanaan, I 
love only thee. ... I am athirst for thy beaufy; 
I am hungry for thy body; and neither wine nor 
apples can appease my desire. What shall I do now, 
Jokanaan? Neither the floods nor the ^eat waters 
can quench my passion. I was a princess, and tboo 
didst scorn me. I was a virgin, and thou didst take 
my virginity from me. I was chaste, and thou didst 
fill my veins witib fire. . . . Ah I ahl Therefore 
didst thou not look at me? If thou hadst looked at 
me thou hadst loved me. Well I know that thou 
wouldst have loved me, and the mystery of love is 
greater than the mystery of death. 



She is monstrous, thy daughter, I tell thee she is 
monstrous. In truth, what she has done is a great

Because the anj^Is have a master surely. 
So to this lord tiiey bowed, all others bowed. 
And swept the marble flags, doffing their caps, 
With the gay plumes. Because he stiffly said.

"Woman, your mistress then returns this purse 
Of forty thousand crowns, is it fifty thousand? 
Come name the sum will buy me grace of her."

My lord, I leam that we have something here, 
In this poor house, which thou dost wish to buy. 
My husband is from home, but my poor fate 
Has made me perfect in the price of velvets. 
Of silks and gay brocades. I think you offered 
Some forty thousand crowns, or fifty thousand. 
For something we have here? And it must be 
That wonder of the loom, which my Simone 
Has lately home; it is a Lucca dunask. 
The web is silver over-wrought with roses. 
Since you did offer fifty thousand crowns 
It must be that. Pray wait for I will fetdi it.

A hundred thousand was it that you said?

Would sell you everytliing the bouse ccmttuns.

Would he sell everything this house contains? 
And everyone, would he sell everyone? 

BIANCA 

Oh, everything and everyone, my lord. 
Unless it were himself; he values not 
A woman as a velvet, or a wife 
At half the price of silver-threaded woof.

He is from home; may be will sleep from borne;

Your lordship.

Say thou canst love or with a silent kiss 

Instil that babny knowledge on my soul.

As a bright butteifly breaks spider's web,

Till yesterday were ghoulish dreams dispersed 
By the great dawn of limpid joyous life.

And though the persons who did haunt that dream 

Live on, they shall by distance dwindled, seem 

No bigger than the smallest ear of com, 

That cowers at the passing of a bird, 

And silent shall they seem, out of ear-shot. 

Those voices that could jar, while we gaze back 

From rosy caves upon the hiU-brow open, 

And ask ourselves if what we see is not 

A picture merely, — if dusty, dingy lives 

Continue there to choke themselves with malice.
