The First Part of King Henry the Sixth . . . ■? 



INTRODUCTION 

There is only one text for Part I. of Henry VI., that of the 
first Foh'o, 1623. In this respect it stands on a different footing 
from Parts II. and III., and for this reason chiefly, it is best 
to consider it here as a play by itself and not as a portion of 
the trilogy: since Parts II. and III. are founded upon earlier 
plays whose texts we fortunately possess. 

But it must be borne in mind that, structurally speaking, 
no such separation is legitimate. Of this we will become aware 
at the beginning of Part II., where the sequence of events from 
Part I. is clearly maintained, and purposely, if somewhat care- 
lessly, adhered to by the same hand or hands. 

Whether Part I. is, as we have it from the Folio, founded 
upon an older play is one of the first questions that occurs ; 
whether in its remodelled state, supposing it to have been so 
founded, it is by Shakespeare, or how much of it is by Shake- 
speare is another question of long-standing difficulty. What 
other authorship is traceable and whose and where ? — all those 
are admittedly amongst the most troublesome that a student 
can be confronted with ; and their difficulty increases as we 
consider Parts II. and III. 

Before entering into these discussions, let us string together 
our facts, touching on the appearance of Part I. 

In Henslowe's Diary (folio 7, p. 13, Bullen's reprint) the 
following entry occurs : " Ne (New) . . . R^^. at harey the vj. 
the 3 of Marche 1591 ... iijH xvjs 8^." Between that date 
and the 22nd of April, 1592 (the following month) there are six 
(or seven) more entries of its appearance, and its popularity was 
greater than such favourites as even Jeronynio or the Jew of 
Malta. Its entries continue regularly down to 31st January, 
1593 (the following year). Titus Andronicus is the only other 



viii THE FIRST PART OF 

Shakespearian drama (for a different company) within this 
period ; and later than " harey." 

Is this Part 1. of Henry VT. ? There is only one piece of 
external evidence to assist us. It is from Nashe's Pierce Peni- 
lesse, which was published in the same year (Grosart's ed. ii. 
88). After proving that plays " borrowed out of our English 
chronicles " are " a rare exercise of virtue," he says : " How 
would it have ioycd brave Talbot (the terror of the French) 
to thinke that after he had lyen two hundred yeare in his 
Toomb, he should triumph againe on the stage, and haue 
his bones new embalmed with the teares of ten thousand 
spectators at least (at seuerall times) who, in the Tragedian 
that represents his person, imagine they behold him fresh 
bleeding." This refers to Act iv. Scenes v., vi., vii. either in 
the Folio play or its forecast. Talbot is "the terror of the 
French " in I. iv, 42. 

It is hard to say how far "New" is to be regarded as 
a legitimate claim. I do not know that it can be stated that 
" ne " does not imply that this is the first appearance of the play 
in question in any shape, a natural assumption. But the mean- 
ing may also be taken that it is an old play so much altered 
as to rest on a new base of popularity. This latter view re- 
quires further proof, the former being the natural interpretation, 
" Further proof" is here found internally. 

One other point should be mentioned here, and that is that 
the fact of the appearance of Part I. in the first Folio at all is 
direct proof that the play was regarded at that date (1623), as 
justly attributable to Shakespeare by the editors Heminge and 
Condell, the best authorities on the subject : authority, I think, 
of greater weight than Meres's negative evidence, to be men- 
tioned presently. 

It is perhaps a slight evidence in favour of the Henslowe 
Diary play being the same as the Folio play, that it was known 
always in the Diary as Henry VI. The subsequent parts in 
their earliest forms had distinct titles, and were not known as 
Henry VI. until they reached the final stage. We have no 
record of the acting of those earlier forms, 

Shakespeare himself laid claim, apparently, to the whole 
three parts ; in the epilogue to King Henry V. " Our bending 
author hath pursued the story," he says : — 



KING HENKV IHE SIXTH ix 

And of it left his son imperial lord. 

Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd King 
Of France and England, did this King succeed; 

Whose state so many had the managing. 
That they lost France and made his England bleed: 

Which oft our stage hath shown ; and, for their sake 
In your fair minds let this acceptance take. 

These words seem intended to refer to the three parts, and to 
their popularity on the stage. But some critics .see nothing 
here beyond a reference to this popularity. 

That Shakespeare was at this date (i 590-1 591) known as 
a hi.storical or heroical writer may be inferred from the lines in 
Spenser's Colin Clout's Come Home Agaitt (1591), which un- 
doubtedly refer to him — from the quibbling on the name : — 

And there, though last not least is Action, 
A gentler shepheard may no where be found : 

Whose Muse, full of high thoughts invention 
Doth like himselfe Heroically sound. 

Shakespeare had written nothing at this date to which these 
words could apply so well as to Henry VI. The dispute about 
the date of Spenser's poem need be only referred to as a need- 
less one, arising out of one interpolation. 

This is the earliest reference to Shakespeare in Ingleby's 
Centiirie of Pray se. 

In view of the extreme interest of this quotation it may be 
excusable to enforce the sense of "heroically sound" from 
Spenser himself : — 

Yet gold al is not that doth golden seeme 

Ne all good knights that shake well speare and shield. 

{Faerie Queene, u. viii. 14.) 

And shivering speare in bloody field first shooke. 

(Faerie Queene, in. i. 7.) 

And from Spenser's constant follower, Peele : — 

Now, brave John Baliol . . . 
And King of Scots shine with thy golden head ; 
(And) shake thy spears, in honour of his name 
Under whose royalty thou wear'st the same. 

{Edward I. 386, a, Routledge.) 

Thus long, I say, sat Sydney and beheld 

The shivers fly of many a shaken spear. {Polyhymnia, 1590.) 



X THE FIRST PAKT OF 

And from Marlowe, Tamburlaine^ Part I. IV. i. p. 25, b: — 

Five hundred thousand footmen threatening shot, 
Shaking their swords, their spears, their iron bills. 

There is one evidence against Shakespeare's authorship 
from an external source, that must be mentioned. It is of no 
positive decisiveness. It is that of Francis Meres {Wits 
Treasury^ 1 598) whose enumeration of the plays at that date 
does not include Hetiry VI. " P^or tragedy his Richard the 2^ 
Richai'd the J, Henry the ^, King John, Titus Andronicus 2ind 
his Romeo and Juliet." Meres may have regarded Henry the 
VI. as joint compositions ; he may have forgotten them for the 
moment ; but what is most probable is that as he was laying 
stress on Shakespeare's most deserving work, he purposely 
passed these plays by. It was an unfortunate omission for 
future critics. 

Meres affects a " pedantic parallelism of numbers " (as 
Brinsley Nicholson called it) in order to bring about his juxta- 
position of English against classical and foreign names that 
somewhat detracts from his worth as an accurate critic, 

Greene's well known virulent attack on Shakespeare in 1592, 
properly belongs to Part III.; or to the whole group. Its con- 
sideration must be deferred for the present with the remark 
that it betrays Greene's extreme irritation, apparently at Shake- 
speare's having made use of work of his and of others, in some 
fashion with such success for the stage. We have no evidence 
that Part I. is a revision except internal evidence — but we 
shall show presently that there is in it much that recalls 
Greene's known work. 

We are left now to the consideration of the play itself, with 
the foregoing evidence that it is in some degree or other 
Shakespeare's. All critics, all readers, will probably agree or 
have agreed that it is one of the least poetical and also one of 
the dullest of all the plays in the P'olio. It is redeemed by few 
passages of merit — its verse is unmusical, its situations are 
usually poorly developed — and were it not for the essential 
interest of the subject-matter, to any English reader it would 
be unreadable. But even there it is blameworthy, since the 
history it contains is jumbled and falsified in perplexing and 
unnecessary ways. 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xi 

Nevertheless there is an easy story-telh'ng method about 
the writing that is freer from bombast and pedantry than the 
usual efforts of the date — it is devoid of brutality and horrors 
for the most part, such as disfigure that revolting play Titus 
Andronicus, which is regarded, or was regarded, as Shakespeare's 
first play and the only one preceding that under notice. Titus 
bears ample evidence, however, of authorship other than Shake- 
speare's, and is now given by some competent critics a later 
date, and even removed entirely from his name. 

We are at liberty to place Part I., in so far as it is Shake- 
speare's, as his earliest work with a date of about 1589-90. 
There is thus a certain space of time in hand for the develop- 
ment of power and experience before the production of Parts 
II. and III. (1 591-2) which are both, especially the last-named, 
of a higher class in all respects. 

Are we to believe then, or try to believe, that the play 
before us is of that date? Or that our version is built (by 
Shakespeare) on a lost and earlier play ? I incline to the 
former opinion. I believe that a close examination of the 
language itself makes that date imperative in so many cases 
that we are bound to grant it ; and the converse is even more 
the case ; that any later date, even for parts of it in any con- 
siderable extent, would be revealed by the same study of the 
language were it existent. There are no such staggering diffi- 
culties with regard to this date, in the text, as confront one, for 
example, when accepting the 1 590-1 591 date for Love' s Labour' s 
Lost. No painful necessity for viewing whole speeches, and 
several topical allusions, as belonging to a period two to three 
years later — painful only to the student chronologically, for no 
doubt they would shine forth in bright relief from the surround- 
ing level of hardly mitigated dulness. 

I see no reason, therefore, to look for an imaginary earlier 
completed play. I am aware that I am in conflict here with 
the views of some critics of importance, but other views than 
my own will be dealt with later. 

There is one confusing result arrived at after a prolonged 
examination. Although we find Greene's methods of expres- 
sion in so many places, the general style is not that of Greene, 
it is much toned down and tamer. Still less does the poetry 
recall Marlowe ; it is devoid of his special grandeur, or inflation, 



xii THE FIRST PART OF 

or rant, whichever one chooses to call it — it is seldom worthy 
of him, and an\'thing of Marlowe in this play is more easily 
regarded as due to his influence, often apparent in Shakespeare's 
early work, or to imitation of him, most natural in an aspiring 
dramatist who aimed at such successes as the author of Tani- 
burlainc had recently achieved. 

Assuredly, however, Greene had a hand in the composition. 
And if his many excrescences of style were toned down by his 
co-operators as the work proceeded, I believe that Peele and 
Shakespeare formed the syndicate. Since these views arose 
from adjusting the parallels amongst the authors concerned, I 
will proceed at once to lay them out in order. One observation 
I will venture on here (and I propose to prove it later, here or 
elsewhere) ; it is this : Spenser's influence on the plays of this 
date has not received sufficient attention. Marlowe and Peele 
made use of him wholesale, and Shakespeare shows his fami- 
liarity with him very often. Oddly enough Greene seems to 
have had less admiration for the greatest of all poets since the 
days of Chaucer. Perhaps " Palin worthie of great praise " 
who envied Spenser's " rustick quill " {Colin Cloufs Come Home 
Again, 392) was Greene. Even where Spenser's style appears in 
Greene, it comes possibly at second hand, sometimes through 
Marlowe — or Peele it may be. 

Such collaboration as appears to have taken place was quite 
usual. The hands of Greene and Peele will be found at work 
together both in Selimiis and Locrine, while Marlowe may have 
assisted in the former. The latter is either imitated or was 
himself at work in Richard III., and he certainly gave help in 
the Contention on which the second part of Henry VI. is built. 
Peele again helped largely in Titus Andronicus, in company 
with Greene, as Mr. Robertson has shown, and as could be still 
further demonstrated. To Marlowe's short career it is not 
easy to add more work, but excellent critics like Mr. Charles 
Crawford find him in evidence in several plays other than those 
known to be his. Any work by Marlowe intended to catch 
popularity would at this date, however, be attributed to him. 
His name was one to conjure with. As Greene died in Sep- 
tember, 1592, and Marlowe in the June of the following year 
(tragedies both unsurpassed in any of their plays), we have abso- 
lute dates and data in limitation of our inquiry. Peele survived 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xiii 

them both, but was dead in 1598. He wrote several plays 
that are lost besides those we have, and no doubt had a share 
in much anonymous or otherwise attributed work. He was 
the author of one of the earliest of the historical plays derived 
from the chroniclers, Edivard the First, wherein however he 
departs widely from history. 

To Peele may be credited also a foretaste of a more agree- 
able and good-natured kind of humour than belongs to any 
other of the dramatists of the time, saving Shakespeare him- 
self. Marlowe and Greene had none — or so little and of so 
poor a quality that it is little better than none — especially 
Greene. The latter also tried his hand at chronicle-play- 
writing — in James the Fourth of Scotland. But his authorities 
are unknown. Both of these may have preceded Henry VI. 
Peele's play almost certainly did. 

Marlowe's play of this kind, Edward the Second, is of 
later date, probably his last piece of work. For more about 
Peele and Marlowe, see Introductions to Parts H. and III. 
respectively. 

These remarks pave the way to the consideration and 
allotment of their shares, and show inherent probability that 
such joint work would have taken place. We can imagine very 
easily that Shakespeare was invited to lend a hand to Greene 
and Peele, and equally easily the idea presents itself that in 
smoothing away much of Greene's turgidity and iteration 
as the work progressed the toes of the older dramatist were 
often trodden upon, that the feeling of rancour increased with 
the success of " harey VI." and that at length it culminated 
and found expression in the famous death-bed attack on Shake- 
speare. 

In an excellent criticism of an edition of Greene's works by 
Mr. Greg in The Modern Language Review (April, 1906) — the 
edition by J. Churton Collins — a review to which my friend, 
Mr. Francis Woollett, directed my attention — I find some 
valuable remarks about Greene's play dates. From a passage 
in the preface to Perimedes (dated 1588), says Mr. Greg, it is 
evident Greene had been scoffed at on the stage for some failure 
connected therewith. This failure may be assigned to Alphon- 
sus as being apparently the earliest by Greene we have, following 
immediately upon Marlowe's Tamburlaine (1587). By con- 



xiv THE FIRST TAKT OF 

necting a passage referring to the lost Delphrygus, in Greene's 
Groatszvorth, with another reference to the same lost play (or 
the King of Fairies) by Nashe in his Introduction to MenapJion 
(1589), Mr. Greg finds Greene began writing for the stage 
when this (or these) were the popular pieces, obsolete in 1589, 
so that 15S7 is the latest date assignable for his earliest effort. 
The argument is perhaps strained, perhaps elusive, but it is 
legitimate. " Orlando must be after Alphonsus.'" Mr. Greg 
.seems to accept a date of 1590 (from Collins) for Peele's Old 
Wives' Tale, and he deems it certain that it followed Orlando 
because there are two passages in common and because the 
character Sacrapantis in both, which Greene took from Ariosto. 
Mr. Greg disagrees with Collins about the authorship of 
Selimus, which play the former rightly continues to ascribe 
(mainly) to Greene — his arguments here are sound and useful 
— Greene, under the influence, no doubt, of Marlowe. It is a 
lamentable thing for Greene's play-writing repute, but it is 
nevertheless probably true, that George-a-Greene is to be re- 
moved from his authorship, or at the very least very strongly 
doubted as his. James the Fourth is placed last in date. In- 
ternal evidence shows it to date 1590-1591, as I have shown 
elsewhere. Needless to say none of the above information is 
due to Churton Collins. The date of 1590 for Peele's Old 
Wives Tale is unacceptable. It must be earlier. The argu- 
ment from common passages, and the name Sacrapant, will 
work the other way. And it is very doubtful if we have any 
dramatic work by Greene as early as, or at any rate earlier, 
than 1586. 

Greene. 

Since Greene is most prominently met with in Part I., I will 
adduce his parallels first. More could be found by more care- 
ful reading, I have no doubt, and those I do adduce by no 
means exhaust my collection, as my notes will show. 

Act I. 

I. i. 23. planets of mishap. " Borne underneath the Planet of 
mishap " (Alphonsus, Grosart, xiii. 391). 

I. i. 67. cause him once more yield the ghost. Without to. Twice 
again in Henry VIII. Uncommon in Elizabethan writers. " Whose 
fathers he causd murthered in these warres " {George-a-Greene). Greene 
wrote a siietch of this scene, but it is mainly by Shakespeare, rewritten. 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xv 

I. ii. 34. skirmish. Often used by Greene. The same applies to mas- 
sacre above, i. i. 135. Uncommon words at this time and seldom in 
Shakespeare. "The skirmish furiously begun, continuing for the space 
of three houres with great massacre and bloodshed " {Euphiies His 
Censure, Grosart, vi. 254). For massacre, see note 11. ii. 18. But 
Greene has not the verb " skirmish." It is frequent in Berner's 
Froissart. 

I. ii. 48. your cheer appard. Not elsewhere in Shakespeare. Occurs 
several times in Greene as distinct from appal. "Neither let our 
presence appale your senses" {Myrrour vf Mudestie, iii. 18). 

I. ii. 72. at first dash. Only here with Shakespeare but a favourite 
with Greene — " shal Fancie give me the i'oyle at the first dash ? " 
{Mamillia, ii. 73). And repeated in Alcida, ix. 59. Earlier in Promos and 
Cassandra by Whetstone. 

I. ii. 95. buckle with. Twice again in this play, and in 3 Henry VI. 
I. iv. 50. Greene has it : " hasted forward to buckle with Acestes " 
{Orpharion, xii. 53): "he marvelled how Scilla durst buckle with his 
great Fortune" (Tritameron, Part II. iii. 131); "buckle with the foe" 
(Alphonsus, xiii. 393). Shakespeare would know this from Grafton 

(1543)- 

I. ii. 148. immortalized. Not again in Shakespeare. Earlier in this 
sense in Greene: "immortalize whom thou wilt with thy toys" {Mena- 
phon, vi. no). He found it in Spenser. 

I. iii. 13. warrantize. Occurs in this sense again only in Sonnei 150. 
A rare word. Greene has "Pawning his colours for thy warrantize" 
{Orlando Fiirioso, xiii. 155). 

I. iii. 38. not budge a foot. Greene has " Bouge not a foote to aid 
Prince Rodomant " {Orlando Furioso, xiii. 155). " I '11 not budge an inch " 
is in Taming of the Shrew. The first three scenes were chiefly written 
by Greene. But Nashe lent aid in Scene ii. ? 

I. iv. 74. martial men. Again in Lucrece 200. " nominate himselfe 
to be a Marshall man " (Greene, Blacke Bookes Messenger, xi. 6). Nashe 
used this earlier. 

This scene is by Shakespeare. Nashe seems again to have assisted. 
Scene v. with its assemblage of natural history metaphors is most near 
Greene. 

I. vi. 22. Rhodope's or Memphis'. "They which came to Memphis 
thought they had scene nothing unlesse they had viewed the Pyramides 
built by Rhodope " (Mamillia, Grosart, ii. 270). And again, p. 280. And 
in The Debate between Follie and Love, iv. 219: "What made Rhodope 
builde the Pyramides . . . but Follie ? " And in Planetomachia, v. 104, 
and elsewhere. Characteristic of Greene. 

This scene recalls Marlowe a little. Compare the last lines to clear 
the stage with Tamburlaine, Part I. end of Act iii. ; and Tamburlaine, 
Part II. end of i. i. ; end of i. iii. and end of 11. iii. The classical 
references may be his. But see under Marlowe. The metre and verse 
is nearer Marlowe than Shakespeare's earliest stage. 



xvi THE FIRST PART OF 

Act II. 

II. i. 4. Court of guard. Compare the position here with that in 
Greene's Orlando Fur ioso, xiii. 134, 135. The term is often in Greene, as 
Meuaphon, vi. 120; Orpharioii, xii. 58, etc. 

II. i. 14. to quittance their deceit. An uncommon verb, not again in 
Shakespeare. Greene has "to quittance all my ils" {Orlando Furioso, 
xiii. 140) ; and " to quittance all thy wrongs" (p. 186) in the same play. 
And again in Philovicla and elsewhere. 

n. i. 77. platform (plan). Not again in Shakespeare, but very com- 
mon in Greene. 

II. ii. 27. dusky vapours. " No duskie vapour did bright Phcebus 
shroude " {Never too Late, viii. 68). 

II. iii. 10. give their censure. Again in 2 Henry VI. and Richard III. 
A favourite with Greene : "to give a censure of painting " {Tritameron of 
Love, iii. 78); and often. 

II. iii. 41. Captivate (captive). A rare word outside Greene. It 
occurs below, v. iii. 107 again : "the mindes of the souldiers captivate by 
their Captaines bounty " {Euphues His Censure, vi. 283). And elsewhere. 

Up to this Greene has had a share, at least, in the composition of 
Act II.; although his work has been retouched in ii. and iii. See Shake- 
speare's part below. Scenes iv. and v. I would allot wholly to Shake- 
speare. 

Act hi. 

III. i. 8. Presumptuous. Outside these three plays, in each of which 
it occurs, Shakespeare uses presumptuous only once in All's Well That 
Ends Well. Greene is very fond of it as suitable to his favourite air of 
bravado, which shows itself in this scene. Greene has it in fames the 
Fourth and twice in Alphonsus. Compare " Presumptuous Viceroy darst 
thou check thy Lord " {A Looking Glasse for London, xiv. 12). Marlowe 
and Spenser both use it, and it was far earlier. 

III. i. 13. Verbatim. Not elsewhere in Shakespeare. "I have not 
translated Lentulus letter verbatim worde for worde" {Tullies Love, vii. 

153)- 

III. i. 15. pestiferous. Only again in All's Well That Ends Well, iv. 
iii. 340. Greene has it several times: "prohibit him from his pestiferous 
purpose" {Mamillia, ii. 118, and again 186). Dissentious (1. 15) is also a 
favourite with Greene. 

III. i. 48. to patronage his theft. This verb occurs again below, in. 
iv. 32 ; and is not known elsewhere except as a word of Greene's : 
"patronage learning and souldiers" {Euphues to Philautus, vi. 151 
(1587)) ; " patronage such affections " {ibid. p. 239). Greene has the verb 
in his epistles to three others of his prose tracts. 

III. i. 43. lordly sir. "Then lordly sir, whose conquest is as great " 
{Frier Bacon, xiii. 54). Shakespeare never uses this word outside these 
plays (I. and II.) excepting once in Lucrece. Probably then, as now, it 
had an unpleasant sneer in it. Greene and Peele have it often. 

in. i. 64. have a fling at. Not elsewhere in Shakespeare and no 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xvii 

earlier example in New Eng. Diet, that is parallel. It is a lavourite with 
Greene: "they must have one fling at women? dispraysing their 
nature" {Mamillia, ii. 76, 77); "did mcane to have a fling at her" {De- 
fence of Conny-Catching, xi. 37). And in Never too Late, viii. 190, and 
again, viii. 218. And in Seliinus (by Greene and Pecle), xiv. 290. Earlier 
in Whetstone. 

III. i. 113. repulse. An uncommon word in the sense of serious 
rebuff". Greene affords an example: "When the Turke doth hearc of 
this repulse, We shall be sure to die " {Alphoiisus, xiii. 381). 

III. i. 99. inkhorn mate. The adjective is not elsewhere in Shake- 
speare, nor is the word anywhere used by him with a sneer. And mate, 
as a term of contempt, disappears early from his work. Mate is fre- 
quent in Greene. See Greene, xiii. 124, 138, 342, 366, 396, etc. One 
of his most usual words. For inkhorn; "an inkhorne desire to be elo- 
quent " {Meiuiphoii, vi. 82). 

III. i. 171. giyt. Again in 2 Henry VI. i. i. 165. "And girt fairc 
England with a wall of brasse " {Frier Bacon, xiii. 77) ; "Go girt thy 
loines " {A Looking Glasse for London, xiv. 51). (See note at passage 
here.) Earlier in Marlowe. 

III. i. igo. feign'd . . . forged. Commonly set together by Greene: 
"fained faith & forged flatterie " {Mamillia, ii. 183) ; " to forge a fayned 
tale " {Alphonsus, xiii. 341). And the first line of the Prologue to Selimns. 
In Spenser's Colin Clout. 

III. i. 192. fester'd members rot. " the festring Fistuloe hath by long 
continuance made the sound flesh rotten " {Mamillia, ii. 125). 

This scene is quite beyond Greene in dignity and continuity of pur- 
pose. But he certainly bore a hand in its construction. 

III. ii. 55. twit with coivardice. Only in Two Gentlemen of Verona 
outside these plays. " She twits thee with Vesta " {Tullies Love, vii. 
167) ; "twit him with the lawes that nature lowes " {A Looking Glasse for 
London, xiv. 12). But see under Peele. 

III. ii. 119. enshrines. This term is found figurativly used both in 
Locrine and Selimus, which proves nothing. New Eng. Diet, has no earlier 
example than the present. 

Scene ii. is probably wholly Shakespeare's. I see no reason to look 
for another's work ; if there be any it would be safest to suggest Peele. 

III. iii. 3. corrosive. Occurs again only in 2 Henry VL in. ii. 403 
where it is a noun. Not an uncommon word in figurative use with 
various spellings, and often used by Greene as in Mamillia: "the cora- 
sive of despair," ii. p. 152, etc., etc. Earlier in Grafton. 

III. iii. 6, 7. peacock . . . pull his plumes. Greene is particularly fond 
of the peacock and his plumes as a metaphor in his prose tracts. For 
pull his plumes (not again in Shakespeare) compare Greene : " Pull all 
your plumes and sore dishonour you " {Gcorge-a-Greene (Dyce edn. 261, b, 
Routledge)) ; " a tawny hiew pulleth downe my plumes " {Metamorphoses, 
Grosart, ix. 22) ; " Solon pulde downe his plumes " {Farewell to Follie, ix. 
260). Marlowe uses this also. 

III. iii. II. foil. Occurs again meaning defeat, miscarriage (Schmidt) 



xviii THE FIRST PART OF 

only at v. iii. 23 below. Often in Greene, but it is also earlier. The 
same words apply also to " sugared words " in line 18, only paralleled in 
2 Henry VI. and Richard III. 

III. ii. 12. secret policies (dodges, tricks). The only plural use in 
Shakespeare. A favourite word with the writer of the Conny -Catching 
tracts : " sundry policies " {Second Part of Conny -Catching, x. 77) ; "now 
He flie to secret policie " {George-a-Greene, xiv. 146). 

III. iii. 61. progeny, meaning descent, is an old use but not met with 
in Shakespeare. Greene used it frequently (see note) : " my progeny 
from such a peevish Parent" {Planetomachia, v. 40, etc.). 

III. iii. 79. roaring cannon-shot. The earliest example of cannon- 
shot in New Bng. Diet., and not again in Shakespeare. Greene has the 
whole expression: "the roaring cannon-shot spit forth the venome of 
their fired panch " {Alphonsus, xiii. 397). 

III. iii. 91. prejudice the foe. The verb is not used by Shakespeare. 
" What daies and nightes they spende in watching either to preuent or 
preiudice the enemie" {Farewell to Follie, ix. 247). And in Never too 
Late, viii. 53. 

III. iv. is so poor a scene and contains such wretched lines that one 
hesitates to ascribe it to any one. It contains Greene's verb patronage 
(1. 32), and his excrescent of (1. 29). miscreant (1. 44) is also a pet word 
with him. So that perhaps he would claim it in addition to Scene iii. 
which has many marks of him. 

Act IV. 

IV. i. is entirely by Shakespeare. Evidences of him, and of no 
one else, appear in every speech. So also of Scenes ii., iii., iv. and v. 
Shakespeare is the author. Scenes vi. and vii., though recalling Greene 
in several places, and possibly written over an effort of his, are Shake- 
speare's down to the entrance of the Herald (vii. 50) ; the latter forty-five 
lines seem mongrel. "The proudest of you all " (v. vii. 88) is a favourite 
with Greene, and would have seemed strong evidence had I not met it 
in Hall's Chronicle. See note at passage, and at 3 Henry VI. i. i. 46. 

Act v. 

V. i. 23. Wanton dalliance with a paramour. Probably by Greene, 
v. i. 28. instaU'd. Very common in Greene. Shakespeare has it 

only in Henry VIII. and 1 and 3 Henry VI. 

V. i. 33. co-equal with the crown. The word is not again in Shake- 
speare. " Make me in termes coequall with the gods " (Greene, Orlando 
Furioso, xiii. 128). See under Marlowe for an earlier use. 

In this scene we have fallen to a very low level of poetry. In Scene 
ii. there is no room or substance for an opinion, but Shakespeare seems 
almost to disappear from this onwards. Note here also how few 
Spenserian parallels occur; Act v. shows hardly any. This accords 
with Shakespeare's work as compared with Greene's. 

v. iii. 6. lordly monarch of the north. " Asmenoth, guider of the 
north " {Frier Bacon, xiii. 62) ; " Astmeroth, ruler of the North " {ibid. p. 
81). For "lordly," see iii. i. 43 above. 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xix 

V. iii. 28. buckle with. A phrase of Greene's. See i. ii. 95. But 
earlier in Grafton's Chronicle. 

V. iii. 56. Swan . . . cygnets. "The Cignets dare not resist the 
call of the old Swan" (Greene, Mamillia, ii. 167). 

V. iii. 79, 80. She 's beautiful . . . to be woo'd ; she 's a woman to be 
won. Greene's words. He has them five times (at least) : Planetomachia 
(1585), V. 56 ; ibid. v. no; Perymedes, vii. 68 ; Orpharion, xii. 31 and ibid. 
xii. 78. 

There are a number of Greene's epithets hereabouts hardly worth 
single mention. Collective they weigh ; such as paramour, counter- 
feited, gorgeous, princely, daunted (xiii. 140, 360, 371), banning (vi. 106). 
Princely occurs five times. One duty of Shakespeare as a " dresser," 
was to remove iteration. 

V. iii. 84. cooling card. Not again in Shakespeare. " there is not 
a greater cooling carde to a rash wit than want " (Greene, Mamillia, ii. 6) ; 
and again in the same piece later, twice. It is a constant phrase with 
Greene in his prose tracts. But earlier in Gabriel Harvey (1573) and 
Lyly's Euphues. Greene made it a sort of hall-mark of his work. 

V. iii. 89. wooden (expressionless, senseless). Compare i. i. ig. 
Greene has "fayre without wit, and that is to marry a woodden picture 
with a golden creast " (Orpharion, xii. 17). 

v. iii. 107. Captivate. See 11. iii. 41. A word of Greene's, but not 
of Shakespeare's in this use. 

This scene was probably written in the rough state by Greene and 
polished and smoothed and finished by Shakespeare. The close of it is 
Shakespeare's. The evidence of Greene is undeniable. But there is a 
perspicuity, an absence of violent hyperbole, and an easy continuity of 
diction in good English that is rarely met with in Greene. But the 
amalgamated result is very deadly dull stuff. Greene's James the Fourth 
is probably later than 1 Henry VI. In it he seems to have remodelled 
his style to some extent. 

V. iv. 56. Spare for no faggots. "Spare for no cost" {Orlando 
Ftirioso, xiii. 164). 

V. iv. is Shakespeare's. But Marlowe's influence is apparent in 
several places. The close of the scene is so lamentably weak and 
washed out, that all one can say is that whoever wrote it he was most 
weary of his task. We have to remember it stands to Shakespeare's 
name in the Folio. At the end of Act v., in several places, Peele may 
have helped. But Shakespeare wrote the last two scenes (iv. and v.) 
and seems to have made Margaret his own property, and resolved to do 
more with her. There is ample evidence of him in these two scenes, as 
my notes will prove. 

Peele. 

I will now exhibit what claim Peele has to a share in / 
Henry VI. We shall see much more of him in Part II. 
Several of the correspondences brought forward in this list 



XX THE FIRST PART OF 

ma\- be reminiscences the other way, since Peele was writing 
for some years later, undoubtedly, than the date of this play. 
None the less the communities of expression must be noticed. 
Although of interest they hardly can be regarded as establish- 
ing his claim. I am claiming, however, for Peele, the author- 
ship of Jack Sfrazv, which will be dealt with in reference to 
Jack Cade's rebellion in Part II. (Introduction). 

I. i. 34. His thread of life had not so soon decayed. "When thread 
of life is almost fret in twain " (Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 409)). 

I. i. 139. all France . . . Durst not presume. 1. i. 156. Make all 
Europe quake. "Search me all England and find four such captains" 
(Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 386)). 

I. ii. 77. parching heat. " Felt foeman's rage and summer's parching 
heat" (An Eclogue gratulatory (1589), Dyce's ed. (Routledge 562, b)). 
See again at Part II. I. i. 79, where summer's parching heat occurs. 
Parching in this sense is characteristically Peele's. 

I. vi. I. Advance our colours. "In whose defence my colours I 
advance" {Descensus Astrcea, 542, b (1591 ?)). But it is in Hall and 
Grafton. 

II. i. 43. follow'd arms. "And rightly may you follow arms, To rid 
you from these civil harms " [Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 382)). In 
the note here Peele's love for trochaic endings is commented upon. 
But they were too usual at this date to be any one's distinction. Pro- 
bably earlier in Marlowe. 

II. iii. 23. strike such terror. "Strike a terror to the rebels' heart " 
(Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 407)). 

II. iv. loi. Noteyou in my hook of memory, " enrol his name in books 
of memory " (twice) {The Praise of Chastity). The uses are not parallel. 

II. V. 80. -ed (laboured) of past tense or participle, sounded for 
metre's sake where usually not sounded. See note here. An early and 
favourite trick of Peele's. 

II. V. 8, 9. These eyes . . . wax dim. "Then first gan Cupids eye- 
sight wexen dim" {Arraignment, 369, a). 

III. i. 171. Girt thee with . . . sword. "And girt me with my sword " 
(Descensus Astrma, 542, b), 

II. V. 13. numb. See note at line. 

III. ii. 31. shine it lihe a comet. " Making thy forehead, like a comet, 
shine " {David and Bethsabe, 467, b). 

III. iii. 74, 75. fight'st . . . join'st. These uncouth monosyllables, 
only here and in Part II., can be paralleled from Peele's earliest work. 
Many others occur in 7 Henry VI., as contriv'dst, serv'st, for'st, com'st, 
hear'st. Fail'st is in Part III. ll. i. igo. 

IV. iii. 25. cornets. Peele has this new military term in Battle of 
Alcazar, i. ii. 423, b. 

IV. iii. 48. great commanders. "The great commander of such 
lordly peers " {A Tale of Troy, 558, a (1589 ?)). 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxi 

IV. iv. 37. the noble-minded Talbot. "Noble-minded Nowell " {Poly- 
hymnia, 570, a (1590)). 

IV. V, 2. stratagems of war. "Train'd up in feats and stratagems ot 
war" {David and Bethsabe, 477, b). 

V. iii. 182. unspotted heart. " His saint is sure of his lunspotted 
heart " {A Sonnet, 573, b). 

V. V. 6, 7. hulk . . . drivenby breath of her renown. " sails filled with 
the breath of men, That through the world admire his manliness" {Ed- 
ward the First (beginning), 1588 ?). 

V. V. 17. full replete with. " Whose thankful hearts I find as full 
replete With signs of joy" {Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 412)). 
"Replete with" is frequent in Hawes, 1509. 

In Shakespeare's later plays and poems echoes of Peele occur not 
unfrequently. For more about Peele in this play, with reference to 
military terms, see under Kyd in Introduction to Part II. As a struc- 
tural whole Peele has nothing to do with 7 Henry VI. Sometimes he 
may have lent a hand, more often his language was recalled. 

Marlowe. 
For parallels from Marlowe's Tamburlaine (both parts) see 
Introduction to Part III. A few references to his Edward II. 
occur in the notes ; as at withered vine, II. v. 11; take exceptions 
at, IV. i. 105 ; Like captives bound to a triumphant car, I. i. 22. 
But Edward II. was probably a later play, certainly it is 
open to question that it was earlier. Tamburlaine is Mar- 
lowe's only work that undoubtedly preceded all Henry VI. 
There is plenty of evidence that it was familiar to, and made 
use of by the writer of / Henry VI. 

Nashe. 

An unexpected group of Nashe reminders may not be 
omitted. They occur almost in a cluster in I. ii. But Act I. 
Scene, ii "makes the senses rough" with a vengeance. I am 
inclined to regard them as later echoes from the play, and as 
Nashe is usually original, he may have been harking back on 
work of his own. However, his reference (already quoted) to 
this play shows he held it in high esteem and remembered it. 

I. ii. I. Mars his true moving . . . to this day is not known. "You 
are as ignorant in the true movings of my Muse as the Astronomers are 
in the true movings of Mars, which to this day they could never attaine 
too " {Have with you to Saffron Walden (Grosart's Nashe, iii. 28,1596)). 

I. ii. II. they must . . . have their provenders tied to tJieir mouths. 
" Except the Cammell have his provender Hung at his mouth he will 
not travell on " {Summer's Last Will, vi. 137 (1594)). 



xxii THE FIRST PART OF 

I. ii. 9-12. They want their porridge . . . look like drowned mice, "en- 
gins ... to pumpe over mutton and porridge into France ? this colde 
weather our souldiors I can tell you, have need of it, and, poore field 
mise, they have almost got the colicke and stone with eating of provant " 
{Fourc Utters confuted, v. 285 (1592)). 

I. ii. g. They want their . . . fat hull-bcevcs. Nashe Preface to 
Sidney's Astrophel and Stella (Arber's E«^. Garner, i. 500), 1591 has: "they 
bear out their sails as proudly, as if they were ballasted with bull beef" 
(but proverbial, and earlier in Gascoigne). 

I. ii. 15. Mad-brained Salisbury. " Mad-braine fondncsse " occurs 
in Nashe's Christ's Teares, iv. 257 (1594)- 

I. ii. 2^. none but Samsons and Goliases. " A bigboand lustie fellow, 
and a Golias, or Behemoth, in comparison of hym " (Have with you to 
Saffron IValden, iii. 125). 

I. ii. 59. unfallible. In Nashe's Pierce Penilesse, ii. 126 (1592) ; and 
elsewhere. 

I. ii. 140. Malwmet inspired with a dove. " Socrates Genius was one 
of this stampe, and the Dove wherewith the Turks hold Mahomet their 
Prophet to bee inspired " {The Terrors of the Night, iii. 228 (1594)). Nashe 
tells the fable again in Lenten Stuffe, v. 258. 

I. iv. 109. Make a quagmire of your mingled brains. " The plaine 
appeared like a quagmire, overspread as it was with trampled dead 
bodies . . . dead murthered men . . . braines " {The Unfortunate Tra- 
velUr, V. 45 (1594)). 

I. V. 5. / 'II have a bout with thee. " Every man's spirit at the 
table had two bowts with the Apostle before hee left " (Pasquils Re- 
turne, i. 119 (1589)). See under Greene. Probably a commonplace. 

A consideration of great help in forming an opinion as to 
which was Shakespeare's unaided work lies in those turns of 
thought and language in this play which become a part of his 
style in his mature work. But it is more than that : it appears 
to me that in his later work, in all his work after these plays, 
he turned his back rigorously on all Greene's diction and 
expressions, shunning them as he would the plague, in conse- 
quence of Greene's venomous attack upon him on his death- 
bed. If this be correct, and it seems to me to be so, the appear- 
ance of Shakespearian passages in these plays is of much more 
importance as a touchstone of his work than otherwise it would 
be. I am not oblivious of the fact that Pandosto (by Greene), 
is the foundation of A Winter's Tale some twenty years later 
when these early troubles were long obliterated. 

Such an analysis as is above suggested would run into 
wearisome use of space, and repetition also from my notes. 
But I will cull a number of prominent passages, simply locating

A selection like the above might be easily varied or en- 
larged, and is bound to be unequal in conviction. I think, 
however, it will give the proper impression to any one familiar 
with " the tongue that Shakespeare spake." Having indicated 
sufficiently Shakespeare's work in the play, and Shakespeare's 
work on Greene's work or in company with Greene, or in the 
dressing of the latter for the stage — Greene having perhaps thrown 
up the task on account of the uncongenial limitations of histori- 
cal facts — I propose to make a still further examination of the 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxv 

language in the play. Perhaps — nay, most probably — we have 
here Shakespeare's earliest dramatic effort excepting only his 
share in The First Part of the Contention. Whose writings, others 
than dramatists, display their influence upon his earliest utter- 
ances ? There are only a few to mention here — but they are 
important since these few remained his favourites. Golding, 
in Ovid's Metamorphoses; Puttenham in The Arte of Eiiglish 
Poesie ; and Spenser's earliest work call for notice. Needless to 
say, the Chroniclers precede these in consideration so far as bulk 
and needful sources go, but they stand on a different and ob- 
vious footing, and will be referred to later. In my Introduction to 
Love s Labour' s Lost ^ I have shown Puttenham's presence there. 
There is less here. In I. vi. 24-27 the passage seems to be 
almost an insertion. The metaphor is boldly seized upon. 
Puttenham's passage is (Arber reprint, pp. 31, 32): " In what 
price the noble poemes of Homer were holden with Alexander 
the Great, in so much as every night they were layd under his 
pillow, and by day were carried in the rich iewell cofer of 
Darius lately before vanquished by him in battaile." Plutarch 
and Pliny mention the coffer, but the wording in the text is 
Puttenham's. 

At p. 112 Puttenham gives some verse of his own: her 
Maiestie 

environs her people round, 
Retaining them by oth and liegeance. 
Within the pale of true obeysance : 
Holding imparked as it were. 
Her people like to heards of deere. 

This simile is that at iv. ii. 45, 46. There is more of Puttenham 
in the late parts. 

A more interesting and important writer is Golding. 
Spenser and Peele, Marlowe and Shakespeare were all familiar 
with, and made use of, his Ovid. In The Return from Par- 
nassus, " Will Kemp " says : " Few of the University pen plays 
well : they smell too much of that writer Ovid, and that writer 
Metamorphosis, and talk too much of Proserpina and Jupiter." 

A good many illustrations from "Master Arthur Golding" 
will be found in my notes, but many are merely earlier au- 
thority for newish or unfamiliar words. I will only refer to 
" more glorious star , . . Than Julius Caesar," l. i. 55, 56 ; " public 



xxvi THE FIRST PART OF 

weal," I. i. 177 ; "overpeer," I. iv. 1 1 ; "sun with one eye," i. iv. 
84 ; ** high-minded," I. v. 12 ; " lavish tongue," II. v. 47 ; " saucy," 

III. i. 45 ; " entertalk," ill. i 63 ; " sucking babe," III. i. 197 ; " do 
execution on," in. ii. 35 ; "take scorn," iv. iv. 35 ; " Unavoided," 

IV. V. 8 ; " lither," iv. vii. 21 ; " admonish me of," v. iii, 3-4 ; " talks 
at random," V. iii. 85 ; "collop of my flesh," V. iv. 18. Shake- 
speare's early love for Golding is, I think, proved. It is very 
prominent in some later plays (as Midsummer NigMs Dream). 

Spenser's Shepheards Calender ^dA published in 15 79- 15 80. 
As early as 1580 Spenser was known to be at work at his 
Faerie Queene^ of which the first three books appeared in print 
in 1590. But they were known to many in manuscript for 
years before. Marlowe, for example, uses the stanza about 
the almond on the top of Selinis in 1586-7, in Tamburlaine. 
And Spenser himself tells us that his Mother Hubberd's Tale 
had been " long sithens composed," although not printed until 
1 591, and further that he was " moved to set it forth by others 
which liked the same." It will be interesting to see if Shake- 
speare fixed much of this matter on his memory. The notes to 
be referred to are selected as follows : — 

Act I. 

I. i. 11-13. Compare with Faerie Queene, i. xi. 14-18: "His blazing 
eyes, like two bright shining shieldes, Did burne with wrath and 
sparkled living fyre. As two broad Beacons . . . warning give that 
enemies conspyre. ... So flamed his eyne with rage and rancorous yre. 
. . . Then with his waving wings displayed wyde." 

I. i. 64. burst his lead and rise from death. Compare with Shepheards 
Calender. June : " Nowe dead he is and lyeth wrapt in lead." A.nAidem. 
October: "all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade." 

I. i. 104. laments . . . bedew King Henry's hearse. Compare Faerie 
Queene, i. xii. 16: "they did lament . . . And all the while salt teares 
bedeawd the hearers cheaks." 

I. i. 124. Here, there, and everywhere enraged he flew. Compare 
Faerie Queene, iii. i. 66 : " Wherewith enrag'd she fiercely at them 
flew. . . . Here, there, and everywhere, about her swayd Her wrathful 
Steele." 

I. ii. 16. in fretting spend his gall. Compare Faerie Queene, i. ii. 6 : 
" did his stout heart eat And wast his inward gall with deepe despight." 
And ibid. in. x. 18: "he chawd the cud of inward griefe And did con- 
sume his gall with anguish sore." 

I. ii. 35. lean raw-boned rascals. Compare Faerie Queene, i. viii. 41 : 
"His rawbone armes." And "His raw-bone cheekes," ibid. i. ix. 35. 
The word seems to be due to Spenser. 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxvii 

I. ii. 148. and be immortalized. Compare Faerie Queene, 11. viii. 13 : 
"Whose living handes immortali^d his name." 

I. iii. 14. dmij^hill grooms. Compare Faerie Queene, iii. x. 15: "his 
liefest pelfe. . . . The dearest to his dounghill minde." And see Faerie 
Queene, 11. xii. 87. 

I. iii. 22. Faint-hearted Woodville. Compare Faerie Queene, i. ix. 
52 : " Fie, fie faint hearted knight ! What meanest thou ? " 

I. iii. 63. One that still motions war and never peace. Compare 
Spenser, Mother Hubberd's Tale {\. 124): " Now surely brother (said the 
Foxe anon) Ye have this matter motioned in season." This very un- 
usual verb (to propose) does not occur in Shakespeare again nor, I 
think, in Spenser. 

I. iv. 43. scarecrow that affrights our cliildrcn. See note at 11. i. 79. 

I. vi. 6. Adonis' garden. Compare Spenser, Faerie Queene, iii. vi. 
29-42. 

Act II. 

II. i. 79. TJie cry of Talbot serves me for a sword. Compare Spenser, 
Shepheards Calender, June, Glosse : "the Frenchmen used to say of 
that valiant captain, the very scourge of Fraunce, the Lorde Thalbot 
. . . great armies were defaicted and put to flyght at the onely hearing 
of hys name. In somuch that the French women to affray theyr chyl- 
dren would tell them that the Talbot commeth." 

II. ii. 2. night . . . whose pitchy mantle. Compare Faerie Queene, i. 
V. 20 : "Where griesly Night ... in a foule blacke pitchy mantle clad." 

II. ii. 18. our bloody massacre. Compare Faerie Queene, iii. xi. 29: 
" the huge massacres which he wrought." 

II. iii. 15-17. scourge of France . . . mothers still their babes. See 
last extract from Shepheards Calender. 

II. IV. 92. stand'st not thou attainted (disgraced). Compare Faerie 
Queene, I. vii. 34 : " Phoebus golden face it did attaint." 

II. IV. 127. to death and deadly night. Compare Faerie Queene, 11. 
iii. 34 : " withhold this deadly howre." 

Act III. 

III. 11. 64. / speak not to that railing Hecate. Compare Faerie Queene, 
I. i. 43: "And threatned unto him the dreaded name Of Hecate: 
whereat he gan to quake." (Also in Golding.) 

III. 11. 127. some expert officers. Faerie Queene, i. ix. 4: "in war- 
like feates th' expertest man alive." 

III. iii. 18. sugar'd words. Compare Faerie Queene, iii. vi. 25 : 
" Sugred words and gentle blandishment." But this is far older. 

III. iii. 29. sound of drum. Compare Faerie Queene, 1. ix. 41 : " at 
sound of morning droome." 

III. iii. 34. lag behind. Compare Faerie Queene, i. i. 6: "Behind 
her farre away a Dwarfe did lag." 

III. iv. 33. The envious barking of your saucy tongue. Shepheards 
Calender, lines to his Book : " And if that envy bark at thee, As sure it 
will, for succoure flee, Under the shadow of his win^." 



xxviii THE FIRST PART OF 

Act IV. 

IV. 1. iSg. TJiis sJiouIdenng of each other in the court. Compare Faerie 
Qut'cuc, II. vii. 47 (describing the Court of Ambition) : " some thought to 
raise themselves to high degree By riches and unrighteous reward : 
Some by close shouldring : some by flattcrie." 

IV. i. 185. rancorous spite. Faerie Queene, n. vii. 22: "rancorous 
Despight." 

IV. ii. 15. O'lVl of death. Compare Faerie Queene, i. v. 40: "The 
messenger of death, the ghastly owle." Golding calls the bird " the 
deathfuU owle." 

IV. vii. 88. proud commanding spirit, and i. ii. 138 "proud insulting 
ship" (see note). Compare Fa^m Queene, i. viii. 12: "proud presumptu- 
ous gate " (gait). And I. ix. 12: "proud avenging boy" (Cupid). And 
I. xii. 14: "proud luxurious pompe," etc. 

IV. vii. 60. the great Alcides. Compare Faerie Queene, i. vii. 17 : 
" great Alcides." 

Act V. shows few Spenserian parallels. But there is a 
certain number of phrases and idioms exhibited particularly in 
tliese plays apart from the rest of Shakespeare's work, which 
are best considered and illustrated with Spenser's help. I 
think I have shown that his writings had an influence on the 
writing of this play that cannot be ignored. I propose to 
prove that further. 

Well I Wot. 

I take the expression "Well I Wot" to start with. It 
occurs in this play (IV. vi. 32) and three times in Part III. 
Elsewhere Shakespeare uses it in Richard II., Midsummer 
Nighfs Dream, and three times in Titus Andronicus. This ex- 
pression has naturally been cited as evidence of Greene's work, 
since he was very fond of the tag. But it is only in his plays, 
I think, that is to say in his late work, and nowhere in his 
earlier prose. "Well I wot" is an old phrase, probably 
northern. It occurs many times in The Towneley Mysteries 
{circa 1460). In the first hundred pages (Surtees Soc. 1836) 
it is on pp. 4, 31, 62, 74, 82. At p. 62 "Full well I wot" (of 
Greene and Titus) is the form. In Grafton's Chronicle I find 
it in Richard II' s deposition speech, and since Shakespeare has 
it in that play (v, vi. 18), that reference would suffice to put 
Greene out of court. But it is also in Peele's writings, four 
times in A Farewell to the General {i^^g), in Polyhymnia, and 
twice in Jack Straw ; and Peele as well as Shakespeare (and 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxix 

Greene) all picked it up from Spenser, who re-introduced it to 
popularity. It will be found in Faerie Queene, I. x. 65 ; " For 
well I wote, thou springst from ancient race," II. Introduction, 
St. i. ("Right well I wote"), II. ix. 6; III. iv. 57 ; Colin Clouds 
Come Home Again (three times) ; Mother HubbenV s Tale ; " For 
well I wot (compar'd to all the rest Of each degree) that 
Beggers life is best " (i 590, " long sithens composed "). Spenser 
has it frequently elsewhere. Spenser naturally shows much 
familiarity with northern dialect. See his Shcpheards Calender 
throughout. 

On the relationship of these plays, in date of appearance, 
to Spenser's Faerie Qneene, see further in my Introduction to 
Part II. 

I. Transpositions such as " Go we," etc. 

The subjunctive of the present followed by we, expressing 
an invitation (Schmidt). This structure is found in many of 
Shakespeare's plays, but it is very much commoner in the 
early ones. Schmidt gives about a dozen references to the three 
Parts oi Hetiry VI. alone, in the present play at II. i. 13 : "Em- 
brace we then the opportunity"; at III. ii. 102: "But gather 
we our forces out of hand " ; and at III. iii. 68 : " Call we to mind, 
and mark but this for proof." I have not noted if Greene affects 
it, but I give it from Seliuius (Greene and Peele), " But go we, 
Lords, and solace in our campe" (Grosart, xiv. 209), Shake- 
speare very wisely dropt this ineffectual method which easily 
becomes silly. It is an archaism, and without claiming its re- 
introduction for Spenser, it may be shown that he used it freely. 
" Go, we " appears to be the parental form. It is in Towneley 
Mysteries (p. 68) : " Go we to land now merely " ; and at p. 221 : 
" Go we to it, and be we strong " and " Set we the tre on the 
mortase " ; and p. 3 1 5 : " Go we now, we two." And in Mati- 
kind (Early English Dramatists) " Go we hence " occurs several 
times. It is not uncommon with Spenser : " Turne we our 
steeds," Faerie Queene, III. viii. 18 ; "Sit we downe here under 
the hill," Shepheards Calender, September (Globe ed. 473, b). 
In (Peele's) Jack Straw, of which more will be said in Intro- 
duction (Part II.), "Stay we no longer prating here" occurs 
(Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 383). See 3 Henry VI. II. i. 199. No 
doubt the verb and its pronoun are readily transposed for ac- 



XXX THE FIRST PART OF 

centuation's sake in the metre — take such a line as " Now come 
we to the final text " and the alteration upsets the rhythm en- 
tirely — but this does not cover the whole case. Marlowe uses 
this inversion frequently in Tamburlaine, but not in forcible 
connections. 

II. Transpositions such as 

"Hung be the heavens with black" (l. i, i); "Rescued is 
Orleans from the English " (l. vi. 2) ; and " For by my mother 
I derived am" (II. v. 74). See notes at I. vi. 2 and at II. v. 74. 
The two vary slightly but may be considered as one. 

This inversion occurs several times in Peele's Arraig7tment 
of Paris as I have noted (1584): — 

Done be the pleasure of the powers above (Prologue). 

Fair Lady Venus, let me pardon'd be (in. ii. 363, a). 

And heaven and earth shall both confounded be (ni. ii. 363, b). 

The man must quited be by heaven's laws (iv. p. 366, b). 

Her name that governs there Eliza is (v. i. 369, a). 

Bequeathed is unto thy worthiness (v. p. 370, b). 

And search will reveal more examples in Peele's earliest 
work, as in Szr Clyomon, " But cover'd will I keep my shield " 
(521, b), and " They forced me through battering blows " (522, a), 
and frequently in that production. 

In Marlowe I find : — 

Discomfited is all the Christian host {Tamburlaine^ Part II. n. iii. i). 
So honour, heaven, (till heaven dissolved be) (v. iii. (71, a), ibid.). 

Later, " Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight " 
at the end of Doctor Faustus occurs. Marlowe, however, was 
not attracted by the construction. Mr. Woollett supplied me 
with only two from him : " Erected is a castle passing strong " 
{^Faustus, vii. 38), and " Broken is the league " {Jew ofMalta^ III. 
V. (164, b)) both too late to be of service here. In Tamburlaine^ 
Part I. (II. i. i): "Thus far are we towards Theridamas" is a 
weak example. There may be better. But no such prevalence 
as is in Peele. 

Mr. Woollett drew my attention to the attraction this in- 
version had for Spenser, who has it a number of times in his 
Ruines of Tirne ; Teares of the Muses ; VirgiPs Gnat ; Muiopot- 
fnos and other poems. None of these, however, precede Peele, 
so they are not historically effective. He also supplied me 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxxi 

with a goodly list from Greene's Alphonsus. But the prevalence 
in Peele militates against this being an evidence of Spenser's 
influence in Greene. Not so with Spenser's influence in Peele's 
Arraigmnent of Paris, where I have already mentioned the 
obvious evidence of his admiration for The Shepheards Calender 
(1579). These examples are of more interest, such as: — 

Then if by mee thou list advised bee (June). 

For he nould warned be (Nfaj'). 

Here wander may thy flocke early or late June). 

Ystabled hath his steedes in lowlye laye (November). 

Xo doubt search would yield more. And it occurs often in 
the first books ol Faerie Qiuene. Spenser appears again to have 
popularised and revived an archaism, for I imagine it to be com- 
mon in early writers, especially in the Miracle plays. It is closely 
paralleled by the last noted transposition, " Go we . . . ." Com- 
pare TJie Towneley Mysteries again ; " Crownyd was with thorn " 
(232) ; " borne was of a madyn fre " (270) ; " in heaven lowsyd 
shall be " (285) ; " that now rehersyd is " (297) ; " Dampnyd be 
we in helle fulle depe" (305). It is very common. Mr. 
Woollett tells me he noted it in Gower. The only note I have 
met \\-ith upon this grammatical construction, in Abbott (425), 
cites I Henry VI. I. yi. 26 : " Then the rich jewell'd coffer of 
Darius transported shall be at high festivals," of which he says, 
" it is rare to find such transpositions " so that a note is needful. 
A reference to the York, Chester, Coventry and Digby mysteries 
showed me at once that this inversion is found in and charac- 
terises all of them. It seems to or was deemed to lend a sort 
of solemn stiffness to the style. " When I perhaps compounded 
am with cla}- '"' is a good instance in Shakespeare's Sonnets. 

III. Lines Constructed with "never"' and 
A Comparative. 

"A stouter champion never handled sword" (III. iv. 19). 
And see IIL ii. 134, 135. With this may be classed the forma- 
tion with "ever" and the superlative, as in 2 Henry VI. I. i. 
15, 16: "The happiest gift that ever marquess gave, The 
fairest queen that ever king received " ; and see also j Henry 
VI. II. i. 67. And a very similar method is also prevalent in 
these plays and other earliest Shakespearian ones : " Was ever 
son so rued a father's death ? Was ever father." etc. (j Henry 

c 



xxxii THE FIRST PART OF 

VI. II. V. 109- III). See also Taming of the Shrew, II. i. 37 
and 327. Often the second is varied to " As true a card as 
ever won the set, As sure a dog as ever fought at head " {Titus 
Androtticus,V. i. lOO, 102). These are all Spenserian favourites. 
They are affected by Peele, but I do not think by Greene in 
any frequency. How common they may be in ante-Spenserian 
poetry I cannot say, but Todd has a note in Faerie Queene (I. 
iii. 9) to " Did never mortall eye behold such heavenly grace." 
" This construction is common in old poetry " — with one quota- 
tion from a Scotch ballad. This is the least interesting of the 
group, and I presume Todd is correct. I find in Stephen 
Hawes, Pastime of Pleasure (reprint, p. 94), 1509 : "Was never 
man yet surely at the bayte With Sapyence, but that he did 
repent." Spenser often recalls Hawes, as in " lady gent " ; 
"pale and wan " ; " flowering age," etc., etc. Now for Spenser : — 

Was never pype of reede did better sounde 

{Shcpheards Calender, December (485, b), Globe ed.). 
Was never Prince so faithful and so faire 

Was never Prince so meeke and debonaire {Faerie Qmene, i. ii. 23). 
Did never mortall eye behold such heavenly grace 

{Faerie Queene, i. iii. 4). 
Was never wight that heard that shrilling sownd, But, etc. 

{Faerie Queene, i. viii. 4). 
Was never hart so ravisht with delight {Faerie Queene, 1. ix. 14). 
Was never wretched man in such a wofull case {Faerie Queene, iii. x. 14). 
Was never so great waste in any place {Faerie Queene, in, iii. 34). 
Saw never living eie more heavy sight {Faerie Queene, iii. v. 30). 

The next structure is more distinctly Spenser's own : — 

A fairer wight saw never summers day {Ruines of Time, 496, a). 
A fairer wight did never Sunne behold {Faerie Queene, in. v. 5). 
A gentler shepheard may no where be found 

{Colin Clout's Come Home Again, 1. 445). 
A fairer star saw never living eie {Astrophel (560, a), 1586-7). 

So is this : — 

The mournfulst verse that ever man heard tell . . . 
Of gentlest race that ever shepheard bore . . . 
The doleful'st biere that ever man did see . . . 
The gentlest shepheardesse that lives this day. 

These lines are from Astrophel (1586-7) on Sir Philip 
Sidney : — 

The justest man and trewest in his dales {Faerie Queene, n. x. 42). 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxxiii 

No one follows Spenser in this respect, taking these as a 
whole, so closely as Shakespeare. Peele has symptoms of it, 
but they do not stand close examination, except in poems of a 
later date than Henry VI. , a reference to which I am avoiding 
carefully. In Lovely London (1585), 538, a, occurs: — 

London give thanks to Him that sits on high 
(Had never town less cause for to complain). 

For a further note on this (with reference to Peele and 
Spenser), see Part II. II. i. 15, 16. It is a pleasant thing to feel 
that "our pleasant Willy," whether Spenser referred to him or 
not in Teares of the Muses, took a continually happy means of 
recalling Spenser in this and in so many other ways. 

In Loa'ine, IV. ii. (partly by Peele) " Was ever land . . . 
Was ever grove so graceless as this grove . . .," etc., recalls j 
Henry VL II. v. 109- III. 

In Tamburlaine, Part II. III. v. (D3^ce 59, a), Marlowe has: 
" For if I should, as Hector did Achilles (The worthiest knight 
that ever brandish'd sword), Challenge in combat any of you 
all." 

IV. Thrice-happy, -valiant, etc. 

There is an adjectival compound that appears very fre- 
quently in Shakespeare, adjectives beginning with thrice. He 
adopts it especially in the early history plays, but he never gave 
it up, and it has remained in circulation ever since. I have 
found no notes on this, and I may be forgiven for stating here 
that this sort of research is entirely my own effort, and there- 
fore liable to copious criticism and perhaps disapprobation or 
negation. The present note is a regular puzzle to me in its 
results. Spenser comes certainly a little way towards helping 
us. He has " thrice-happy " several times in his early work (to 
which I am confined) : — 

Thrise happ3' man ! said then the father grave {Faerie Queene, 1. x. 51). 
Thrise happy man the knight himselfe did hold (Faerie Queene, i. xii. 40). 
Thrise happy man ! (said then the Briton knight) (Faerie Queene, n. ix. 5). 
Thrise happy she, whom he to praise did chose (Astrophel, 1. 36). 

He has it also in Ruines of Time, and in Colin Clout's Come 
Home Again. I have not noted the phrase in Greene. But it is 
in Kyd's Spanish Tragedy. Peele, however, abounds in it (and 
Locrine, of later date, gives " Thrice-happy " and " thrice-hap- 



xxxiv THE FIRST PART OF 

less," IV. i.). So far as I have tracked it out this very useful 
and popular mode of expression is due to Spenser's "thrice- 
happy " expanded (as follows) by Peele, and accepted by Mar- 
lowe, Shakespeare and every one else. It is interesting to see 
how speedily Gabriel Harvey adopted it. Of course there is no 
literary achievement of note in this compound. It is simply 
an adaptation from Homeric Greek and other writers of classi- 
cal times. But as a test of dates and authorship goes, it may 
prove to be of value. The very suddenness of its appearance 
in our writers, like an epidemic, is itself a phenomenon. 

Spenser had submitted his Faerie Queene^ or the beginning 
of it, to Harvey, for judgment before 1580. We may therefore 
take that date as a starting-point. 

Peele has 1 " thrice-reverend " thrice in his Arraignment of 
Paris, 1584, his earliest dated work, in which The Shepheards 
Calender is obviously recalled : " And you thrice-reverend 
powers " (365, a) ; " And thus, thrice-reverend, have I told my 
tale" (366, a): "Thrice-reverend gods" (367, b). 

From that on Peele used it freely. In Edward I. he has 
" thrice- valiant " (380, b) and "thrice-renowned" (402, b). In 
The Battle of Alcazar " thrice-noble," " thrice-happy," " thrice- 
valiant " and " thrice-puissant" (423, a) appear. And later in his 
signed writings he uses " thrice-honourable," " thrice-haughty," 
"thrice-worthy," and "thrice-wretched." The last {The Tale 
of Troy, 558, a) is, I think, the only use he has, not as an epithet 
of personal address. Lodge has " thrice-renowned " in Wounds 
of Civil War. 

It is noteworthy that the figure does not appear in Sir 
Clyofnon which must be Peele's, and also must be his earliest 
effort. But as if to emphasise this bit of evidence he has at the 
end "twice-welcome to thy knight" (533, bj. 

Gabriel Harvey plunges into " thrise-sweet " (Grosart, ii. 5) ; 
" thrise-afifectionate" (ii. 10); " thrise-curteous " (ii. 5); "thrise- 
lavish" (ii. 10); "thrise-gr ace-full " (i. 244); " thrise-happie " ; 
" thrise-learned " ; " thrise-secret " ; " thrise-profound." But all 
these are later and date about 1 592. 

As it is impossible to put some of Peele's usages after i 
Henry V/., we must give him the credit of developing the ex- 
pression from Spenser's earliest " thrise-happy," acording to the 
evidence at my disposal. 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxxv 

Henry VI. (Part I.) yields "thrice-victorious" (iv. vii. 6^) 
and "thrice-welcome" (I. ii. 47). Part II. has "thrice-famed" 
and " thrice-noble." Love's Labour's Lost has " thrice- worthy." 
The words in Part II. are noted on where they occur in III. i. 
266 and III. ii. 157. 

Although thrice-happy is not in Shakespeare, it is in the 
True Tragedie (Q i of j Henry VI.), at the beginning of I. iv. : 
" Thrice-happie chance it is for thee and thine," but omitted in 
four excerpted lines from the finished play. And in the same 
play at II. ii. 15 "thrise valeaunt son " occurs, which is omitted 
from J Henry VI. also, although in Titus Andronicus. More- 
over, from The First Part of Contention, I. i. 188, "thrice 
valiant " is deliberately omitted ; "Warwick my thrice valiant 
son," reading " Warwick, my son " in the final play. 

It is well to mention here how the case stands with a few 
other prominent plays of this date. Kyd has " thrice happy " 
in each of the three plays The Spanish Tragedie, Cornelia and 
Solinian and Perseda, the first of these being the only one that 
precedes / Henry VI. probably. It is one of Kyd's frequent 
echoes from Spenser. In Soliman and Perseda occurs another : 
"welcome, thrise renowned Englishman" (I. iii. 12, ed. Boas). 

A more interesting state of affairs is found in Edward III., 
a play of great and acknowledged merit. Using Dent's reprint 
(edited by G. C. Moore-Smith), I find "thrice-gracious" (p. 
23); " thrice-dread" (p. 24) ; " Thrice-noble " (p. 34) ; "thrice- 
valiant" (p. 37); and "thrice-loving" (p. 40, and again). 
These occur, all I think, in the first two acts, the best part 
of the play, the parts which are attributed to Shakespeare. Or 
to Shakespeare and Peele as I believe. It is a significant clue. 
The play was entered in Stationers' Register, ist Dec, 1595. 

With Marlowe's use of these terms in Tamburlaine I will 
deal in j Henry VI. (Introduction). Marlowe had Spenser's 
"thrice-happy," and Peele's "thrice-reverend" to go upon. 
But he is found at once developing it as Peele does. Marlowe 
has "thrice-noble," "thrice-renowned," "thrice-welcome" in 
Tamburlaine, Part I.; and " thrice- worthy " in Tamburlaine, 
Part II. Peele went only a little way therefore in front. Later 
he may be looked on as following Marlowe as he often does. 

Following the lead of thrice -happy, the compound seems to 
be always favourable. Peele has however " thrice- wretched 



xxxvi THE FIRST PART OF 

lady" (558, a) ; and Lodge has " Romans thrice accursed" in 
Wounds of Civil War. 

V. Nouns formed into Adjectives with Suffixes 

-LESS, -FUL, AND -Y OR -ISH. 

At the time this play was written our language was in a 
more than usually pronounced condition of flux and reforma- 
tion. All capable writers took what licence they pleased with 
words. Whether their efforts were to be lasting or ephemeral 
depended partly on the effort itself, but more largely on the 
fame and impress of the writer, both contingencies being in 
the lap of posterity. No writer had such a mastery over these 
manipulations of word-meaning and word-shaping as Shake- 
speare. No one seized more boldly on a term for a momentary 
need, whether new or newly applied, whether adopted or re- 
jected when needless, than Shakespeare. Hence every play 
has its own series of terms not met with elsewhere, often 
merely "nonce-words," but frequently crystallised into our 
language. Some of these coinages may be dealt with in 
groups and lead to interesting generalisations with respect to 
Shakespeare's earliest work — words whose appearance in litera- 
ture I have long been taking note of. Roughly speaking, the 
beginning of the sixteenth century may be taken as a stand- 
point. Stephen Hawes' work The Pastime of Pleasure, 1 509, 
a very popular allegory with subsequent writers, is a useful 
guide or landmark, but no great series of changes took place 
perhaps till the middle of the century. I propose to deal 
rapidly with a few of these as evidenced in these plays. And 
first with adjectives formed from nouns by the suffix -less. 
Schmidt deserts us here and New Eng. Diet, has merely a 
general paragraph, which informs us that the practice was 
ancient, but the power seems to have been very slightly used 
and then laid by. Arthur Golding in his translation of Ovid's 
Metamorphoses (1565- 1567) made free use of these expressions. 
He gives helpless, heedless, headless, wiveless, knotless, hurt- 
less, luckless, pleasureless, tongueless, lightless, careless. Most 
of these are new. 

Next in order of date who indulged in this direction, is 
Spenser. His early work yields hurtless, knightless, senseless, 
dreadless, hapless, heartless and hopeless, breathless, causeless. 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxxvii 

favourless, helpless (merciless), heedless, lustless, careless, grace- 
less, hostless, vvoundless, trustless, rueless (unpitied), quench- 
less, witless {ante 1590). Spenser has a tendency to group 
them {Faerie Queene, II. vi. 41, etc.), and so have Kyd, 
Shakespeare, Peele. 

Next in sequence may be taken Peele. Not repeating the 
common words already mentioned he gives (down to 1 593) 
endless, bloodless, ruthless, successless, quenchless, mirthless, 
trothless, breathless, soul-less, glory-less, numberless, dateless, 
waveless, kindless, spotless, sapless, stringless, cloudless. 

Peele made obviously an effort in this direction. He strings 
them together in several places, metrically, and is responsible 
for some useful words. 

Marlowe does his own share at the same time, or a little 
later (Peele's earliest work precedes Marlowe's). Marlowe 
stretches the sense of -less into " not able to be " more than the 
others perhaps. See Ward's Doctor Faustus, who is the only 
commentator I have found on this subject. Marlowe has timeless, 
topless, quenchless, expressless, resistless, remediless, removeless, 
ruthless, attemptless, fleshless, forceless, resistless, lustless. 

We now come to Henry VI. and Shakespeare. It may be 
mentioned that at an immediately later date Sylvester in his 
Du Bartas carried on the coinage assiduously. 

Shakespeare fell into line with his predecessors in his early 
work in this respect. In fact he kept this string to his bow- 
always ready for use, but the Spenserian influence waned with 
time. In i Henry VI. he gives us (those in italics are pe- 
culiar to the play) : sapless, pithless-, crestless, strengthless, reason- 
less, timeless, heedless. In 2 He?iry VI. criineless. In j 
Henry VI. luckless, quenchless. In Taming of the Shrew, 
shapeless and coinbless. In Two Gentlemen of Verona, conceit- 
less. In Richard II. stringless. In Sonnets, makeless. In 
Lovely's CojHplaint, phraseless, termless. But one conclusion 
appears undoubted, that he dropped the trick except at im- 
pulsive moments, and discontinued it as a practice after his 
earliest work, especially / Henry VI. He never became en- 
slaved. These forms often occur in groups, as in j Henry VI. 
II. V. It is so with all who adopt them ; two, or more at a 
time. See Lodge, Wounds of Civil War (Hazlitfs Dodsley, 
V. 116, 141, 196); and Peele, /^j'.fzW. Sqq i Henry VI. II. v. 



xxxviii THE FIRST PART OF 

II, 12, 13. See also j Henry VI. II. vi. 18, 23, 25. And the 
first stanzas of Lucrece. 

Compounds with Prefixes Ever, and Never, from 
Participial Adjectives. 

A few of these, ever-during, ever-lasting, and ever-living 
are very early, going back to the first part of the fourteenth 
century as dealt with in New Eng. Diet. The next .in date 
cited is "ever-increasing," 1570 (T. Norton, translation). Sid- 
ney seems then to have given an impetus in Arcadia {ante 
1586) ; he has ever-flourishing in the first few pages. 

About the same date Spenser took this mode under his 
wing. In the first Canto of The Faerie Queene he has ever- 
damned, ever-drouping, and ever-drizling in stanzas 38, 39, 
and 41. Ever-burning occurs also, twice, in the first book. 
And ever-dying is found in i. x. 9. While the old ever-living is 
used in I. x. 50. 

This latter occurs in the present play, IV. iii. 51, and is 
followed immediately by ever-esteemed in Loves Labour 's 
Lost. Later, Spenser has ever-running, ever-preserved, ever- 
fixed, ever-fired, ever-during, and ever-burning. Marlowe uses 
a few of Spenser's, including ever-drizzling, Kyd has ever- 
glooming in The Spanish Tragedy. 

Spenser's Faerie Queene gave an impetus to this use. 

Forms with " never " are not affected much by Shakespeare. 
None appear in Henry VI. But he has never-conquered and 
never-ending in Lucrece ; never-dying and never-daunted (the 
latter was common) in Henry IV. ; never-quenching in Richai'd 
II. ; never-resting in Sonnet 5 ; and in his latest work never- 
suspected and never-withering occur in Tempest and Cynibeline. 

Spenser used never-resting earlier in Mother Hubberd' s 
Tale, but I have not noted these in his earliest work. 

Peele and Kyd, or Peele followed by Kyd, have several. 
The former has never-ceasing and never-dying in Alcazar and 
the Arraignment. The latter gives never-dying and never- 
killing in Spanish Tragedy ; ne'er deceiving in Cornelia. 

Marlowe adopted these compounds in Tamburlaine. He 
has ever-howling, ever-green, ever-raging, ever-turning, ever- 
shining. He has also never-broken, never-fading, never-stayed, 
in adjectival use — all in first and second Tamburlaine. 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xxxix 

Compounds with Over as a Prefix. 
Shakespeare had a great partiality for these, made up with 
several grammatical parts of speech. New Eng. Diet, has 
given a number due to him in the first instance. Ben Jonson 
followed closely on his heels. But all writers used them and 
the subject is altogether too wide and diffuse to be slurred 
over here. I find many in Golding's Ovid for the first time. 
Sidney has a number of them in Arcadia. Spenser seems to 
use those older ones that came to his hand, oftenest. Peele 
coins several. So does Kyd. Perhaps about four apiece in 
their early and undoubted work. But no one approaches 
Shakespeare in the liberality with which he pours them out. 
In the present play, over-awe, over-daring, over-matched, over- 
mounting, over-tedious, over-veiled, may be mentioned. 

Adjectives formed from Substantives with the 
Subject -ful. 

These are more abundant, naturally, carrying with them a 
development and extension of an idea as they do instead of 
a negation of it, like words in -less. New Eng. Diet, gives 
a paragraph upon them which is of the same purport as that 
under -less. Many are old, but like the last a new vogue 
came in, culminating in Shakespeare's work. These words are 
on a higher grade and better class : they belong to riper works 
and do not as a group denote an affectation or a peculiarity so 
much as the last — except in the fact of coining and dallying 
with construction being itself rather a puerility. The extension 
here is of earlier date, I think, than the last. We have an 
excellent list in Schmidt for Shakespeare. I have made no 
list from Golding. Spenser, however, has spoilful, groanful, 
threatfull, stryfuU, gladfull, wailfull, gastfull (this is in Golding), 
vauntfull, choicefull (besides the older guileful, doleful, direful, 
etc.). Several of Spenser's are coinages showing that he had 
taken it up deliberately. 

I have not noted this to any characteristic extent in Peele 
or Marlowe. Greene seems to have had little tendency to origi- 
nal word-making in any direction whatever. Sylvester indeed 
goes at it at once, but Shakespeare had preceded him with 
strenuous efforts and examples. Sylvester has mastful (oak), 
fishfuU (sea) early in his work. 



xl THE FIRST PART OF 

Shakespeare has the following only once : disgraceful, dis- 
trustful in / Henry VI. ; fraudful, deathful, unhelpful in 2 Henry 
VI. ; mirthful, easeful, wishful in j Henry VI. In Luci'ece 
only are increaseful, faultful and mistful. Gleeful and might- 
ful are only in Titus Andronicus. Dareful and fitful only in 
Macbeth. There are but few others peculiar and they demand 
no notice here. Again we see the influence of Spenser with 
his wonderful poetic vocabulary in the growing genius of 
Shakespeare; and predominating in Henry VI. Fretful in 2 
Henry VI. is quoted in New Eng. Diet. But it may be earlier 
in Kyd. Cornelia, certainly, is earlier than New Eng. Diet. 
date ("1593")- 

With the Suffix -ish. 

There is also an early formation, but belonging chiefly to 
proper or national names. It is more amply dealt with in 
New Eng. Diet, than the preceding ones from a historical 
view, but not illustrated except from modern times as an or- 
dinary means of obtaining an adjective. It was apparently 
an idle arm, for the most part, until Golding, and subsequently 
Spenser, handled it, and polished it by use. The suffix has the 
sense of " somewhat " when applied to another adjective : 
'•somewhat like a" when added to a noun. 

Golding leads the way with snakish, sheepish, saltish, 
moorish, sluggish, raughtish (grunting), currish, an interesting 
list for his date. 

Spenser has clownish, brackish, dampish, sluggish, currish, 
moorish, goatish. He evidently helped himself from Golding. 
But I am not postulating originality for any of these. And 
there is not much business doing in -ish evidently. Sir Philip 
Sidney used it sometimes — he has at any rate gluttonish, shep- 
herdish and lobbish in Arcadia. 

Shakespeare has only a handful of these words, and I doubt 
if he adds any. I have no exhaustive list. Shrewish, elvish and 
dankish are confined to Comedy of EtTors ; brinish is earlier in 
Lyly's Euphues. Brainish {Hamlet) is no doubt new-minted. 
There is no need to pursue this inquiry since it is outside 
Henry VI. 

The use of the pronoun there in Shakespeare is well dealt 
with by Schmidt, and by Abbott. There was a very subtle 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xli 

discrimination usually between thou and you. As the word is 
now almost discontinued, in ordinary use, so also is the inflec- 
tion -est to the verb in the past tense, second person. The 
language arising has a Biblical cast in modern ears, but in 
Shakespeare's time it had hardly acquired that distinction. 
But as Abbott (231) points out it was becoming archaic to use 
thou except in the higher poetic style and the solemn language 
of prayer. The termination in -est was felt to be ponderous, 
and too serious. These three plays exhibit a group of these 
" ponderous " examples, which are seldom found in the later 
ones. They are felt to be noteworthy on account of the some- 
what terrific need of elision in pronouncing such a word as 
" suckedest " as a monosyllable. This occurs in i Henry VI. 
V. iv. 27 : — 

the milk 
Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dest her breast. 

And in Coriolanus, III. ii. 129; and in Titus Andronicus^ II. iii. 
144, Marlowe has an example in Edward II. (Dyce, 211, a) : 
"that philosophy . . . Thou suck'dst from Plato and from 
Aristotle." 

Here are a few examples : — 

Sentest. Titus Androniciis, iii. i. 236. 

Meantest. 2 Henry VI. iii. ii. 222 (Peele uses this). 

Wentest. 3 Henry VI. in. i. 54. 

Dlppedst. 3 Henry VI. i. i. 157. 

Caliedst. 2 Henry VI. iv. iii. 31 (and twice elsewhere in Shakespeare). 

Oheyedst. 3 Henry VI. ni. iii. 96. 

Strokest. Tempest, i. ii. 333 (purposely stilted). 

Oughtest. 2 Henry VI. iv. vii. 54. 

Soughtest. Antony and Cleopatra, v. ii. 335 (the " high Roman style.") 

The latter two are Biblically familiar. No doubt there are 
more in Shakespeare, but they seem to be somewhat charac- 
teristic of these three plays, and therefore dwelt on a little. 

Hardly more euphonious are the corresponding present 
tense monosyllables, noted already under Peele. Shakespeare 
probably desisted purposely from these in his later work as his 
ear grew more musically exacting. Serv'st, forc'st, com'st, 
hear'st, fight'st, join'st, and others all occur, monosyllabically, 
in / Henry VI. Peele used these freely. But so do modern 
poets. Shelley has speak'st, somewhere, three or four times in 
as many lines. 



xlii THE FIRST PART OF 

With the Suffix -y. 

Adjectives from nouns formed with the suffix -y are very 
conspicuous in Spenser. Many of them are his own undoubted 
introductions. He had grassy, calmy, watery, hoary, misty, 
frothy, sappy, dewy, starry, foamy, rosy, finny, shiny, airy, 
fleecy, plumy, snowy, scaly, frory, pearly, gloomy, briny, 
leamy, heedy, vetchy, bushy, weedy, cloudy, horsy, whelky, 
fenny, slimy, snaky, ashy, muddy, balmy, cooly, in his early 
work. A very great list with numbers of interesting words. It 
must not be assumed that several of these, now very common, 
were so in his time, or ever in use at all. Golding is not 
noteworthy in this respect. 

Shakespeare has many of the above. He has also slumbery, 
womby, vasty and paly in his later works. Mothy and pithy 
belong to Taming of a Shrew. But I only find him once in- 
dulging in a bout of such terms, and that is in a very appro- 
priate place. Midsummer Night's Dream, wherein he is 
especially reminiscent of Spenser. He has there, only : wormy, 
sphery, starry, rushy, barky, batty, brisky, unheedy. He sets 
a friendly seal of approval on Spenser's trick. 

In the foregoing efforts of research, I have read no prede- 
cessors, and they are altogether too comprehensive to at- 
tempt singlehanded with any finality. I trust my errors are 
not many and that my conclusions are sound as a rule. It 
seems to me that some such methods will prove more reliable 
in coming to a knowledge of the chronological position and 
sequence of literary compositions, and of their authors even, 
than any other internal test, not excepting metrical ones which 
often break down and seldom extend past the field of a single 
writer's own work, except in unsettled boundaries. Or even, 
if that be an unfair view, these tests of new compounds are 
importantly additional. Now that New Eng. Diet, has pro- 
gressed so far and so splendidly there is always a final court of 
appeal. I have usually referred to it, but my collections are 
from my own reading, and my instances precede theirs oc- 
casionally. 

Note on the Chronicles. 

In the historical events of this play Shakespeare follows 
sometimes Hall, occasionally Grafton, and commonly Holin- 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xliii 

shed. I have made use of Grafton where possible, since his 
chronicle has been usually neglected ; and in its earliest parts 
(Hall begins with Henry IV.), his pleasant writings afford 
many illustrations of Shakespeare's language. For the Henrys, 
Grafton (1567) may be taken as identical with Hall (1548) 
from whom he transcribed. But he also omitted, added, and 
in a much less degree altered. Hall a few times. Holinshed 
varies from both in Henry VI. Shakespeare made use of 
him of course. All this is fully dealt with in Boswell Stone's 
admirable summary of Shakespeare's Holinshed. But I am 
urged to say this much in extenuation of my use of Grafton, 
admittedly an inferior source to the others. I found evidences 
of his having been consulted ; I found him lighter reading than 
the others with some room for original research ; and I wished 
to do this for myself The evidences will appear from time to 
time in my extracts. For example, the St. Alban's Scene (ii. i) 
in 2 Henry VI. (from Sir Thomas More's Dialogue) is told by 
Grafton only. It is more likely Shakespeare found it there 
than in More (1530). As a rule Holinshed and Grafton both 
paraphrase Hall. As a rule Shakespeare used Holinshed. But 
there is evidence that he used Hardyng, Fabyan and Stowe in 
addition. For Fabyan, see Part II. IV. iii. at the word "sallet." 
For Hardyng see Boswell Stone, p. 262 ; and see the same au- 
thority for Stowe in two or three places. Grafton was made 
use of again, probably, where episodes from Hall and Jack 
Straw's rebellion (1381) are woven into Cade's. 

There is one remark I wish to make with regard to the 
Chroniclers. They afford an excellent hunting ground (Grafton 
in particular perhaps) for Shakespearian expressions. Not 
illustrations of a historical nature or with any reference to the 
historical plays, necessarily, but of passages and turns of phras- 
ing in Shakespeare's later work — where he drops them har- 
moniously in unexpected places from the store-house of his 
memory. 

In addition to the above paragraph I find Polydore Vergil 
yielding two or three useful notes in Part III., as at 11. vi. 30, 
and II. V. I. And also of Edward's love for the ladies at III, ii. 

14, 15. 

Philip de Commines (Danett's translation was not available) 
comes in with advantage at v. ii. 31, and v. iii. 20, 21. 



xliv THE FIRST PART OF 

In Part II. IV. x. i et seq., where Iden finds Cade in his 
garden, Hoh'nshed is not followed. The account is from Graf- 
ton or Hall. 

It is not necessary to suppose that Shakespeare made a 
continuous study of all, or indeed of any of these chroniclers, 
excepting perhaps Holinshed. Probably at first he used 
whichever came handiest at whatever friend's library he had 
access to, and sometimes one writer, sometimes another. No 
doubt he soon possessed a Grafton and a Holinshed of his own. 
In speaking of Grafton I have omitted to distinguish Grafton's 
Continuation of Hardy ng (1543) which is earlier than Hall's 
Chronicle. For the latter part of Henry VI. and for Richard 
HI., Shakespeare undoubtedly used this. He took many 
expressions into his texts from it, as my notes will show. 

With regard to Grafton's popularity, Gabriel Harvey bears 
testimony. He refers to " Grafton's, Stowe's, or Holinshed's 
Chronicle" in Pierces Supererogation (Grosart, ii. 196), 1592-3. 
He had already, as early as 1580, mentioned Holinshed (i. 91), 
the 1577 edition. The inter-relationship of these compilers is 
very complicated and need not be touched upon. Stowe upon 
Grafton {Survey) is painful reading. 

Another consideration in favour of Grafton is that his 
Continuation of Hardyng in 1543, is prior to all of Hall's work. 
But it does not deal with our period except at the very con- 
clusion. 

It is necessary here to say a word with regard to the author- 
ship of this work ; belonging in part to Sir Thomas More, and 
in part to Grafton. See Sir H. Ellis's Introduction to the 1809 
edition. Boswell Stone quotes mostly, in Richard III.^ from 
Holinshed, who ascribes to Sir Thomas More. Grafton's ver- 
sion is varied considerably, chiefly compressed. Holinshed 
says that " Edward the Fifth and Richard the Third unfinished " 
were written about the year 15 13. Grafton overlaps this at 
each end, beginning with Edward the Fourth and continuing 
to Henry VIH., " gathered out of the most credible writers." 
The part that is common to both is for the most part identical. 
Shakespeare need not necessarily therefore have used Holin- 
shed. Some expressions such as " lay their heads together," 
are not in Holinshed, in this position at any rate. Holinshed 
is Grafton amplified {i.e., More) for Edward V. (468 to 515 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xlv 

Grafton = 361 to 396 Holinshed) ; and Holinshed is Grafton 
in Richard III. to 525 in the latter after "^sop's tale" where 
Holinshed says " Here endeth Sir Thomas Moore, and this 
that follovveth is taken out of master Hall " (405). Stowe's 
Richard III. omits a line (II. iii. 11), "Woe to that land that's 
governed by a child" which is in Grafton (511) and in 1588 
Holinshed's reprint (393), but has escaped the editors. 

A few chronicle expressions appearing in these plays occur 
to my memory : break up (a prison, etc.), in Christendom^ pro- 
curator^ cutting short (one's head), conventicle^ play a pageant, 
laid their lieads together (consulted), subversion, triple crown 
(mitre), fleeced, at large, corsie, sallet. And many military or 
warfare phrases : such as bid them battle, buckle with. Most of 
these, and several more, are in Grafton, 1543, knitting the 
brows, came up, make a short tale, break off (conversation), 
pangs of death. 

Mr. Francis Woollett called my attention to evidence of 
the "heterogeneous nature of the construction " of this play in 
two special cases, as well from a close study of several episodes. 
The episode of Talbot and the Countess of Auvergne has no 
meaning and probably belonged to the earlier draft — it reads 
like an adventure out of a Robin Hood ballad. The two 
cases referred to are the making Winchester a Cardinal in 
Act I., while in Act V. (i. 28) Exeter says : " What ! is my Lord 
of Winchester install'd, And call'd unto a Cardinal's degree ?" 
Again in Act I. (i. 61, 65) Paris is quite lost to the English, 
yet Henry is crowned there in Act IV. Scene i. And at I. i. 
60 Orleans is quite lost, while this is contradicted by the third 
Messenger's speech a little lower down. Such historical con- 
fusion is most easily explained by hasty overwriting of early 
work by another. 

It would be a thankless and unnecessary task to point out the 
depths oi Henry VI., Part I. Enough has been said already 
both in this Introduction and my notes. It must be conceded 
that even this prosaic production is lightened up here and 
there by redeeming passages and even scenes. And that as a 
coherent narrative play with some attempt at depicting human 
nature as it really is in times of storm and stress, it rises above 
its predecessors on the English stage. Even Shakespeare had 
to begin. He began on another's failure and Greene's " nature 



xlvi THE FIRST PART OF 

is subdued," by the worker, to the dyer's hand. The resultant 
hue is in places a very strange medley. The Greene shows 
through the Shakespearian varnish. When we come to study 
this retouching in the later parts, with the original canvas 
before us, we get some idea of the processes at work, but the 
parallel is not legitimate, since here there was perhaps no 
more than a few hasty sketches of unfinished scenes and posi- 
tions, speeches to be made use of and probably unwelcome 
personal assistance from Greene. One feels the presence of 
Greene, but little by little, in my case at least, this presence 
became more and more shadowy, and finally it practically 
vanishes from the finished product. It is curious how a few 
impressions at the start lead one into a track that is difificult to 
ever wholly escape from. I have shown how some of the 
Greene language is really Spenser's. In the later parts certain 
recognised Marlovian phrases belong properly to the Chroniclers. 

It is necessary to give a brief summary of the conclusions 
of the more important critics and commentators on the author- 
ship of this play. After I had made a careful study of the 
three parts I studied the opinions of others, with many of which 
I was of course to some extent familiar. Theobald and War- 
burton both doubted the Shakespearian authorship of all three 
plays, although finding some of his "master strokes" in them. 
Johnson very properly said : " From mere inferiority nothing can 
be inferred ; in the productions of wit there will be inequality," 
and after a few more solemn truisms, he opposed himself to 
Theobald and Warburton without any knowledge whatever of 
the writings of Shakespeare's contemporaries — the whole field 
of conflict and point at issue. Malone gave his decisive opinion 
that this play was not by Shakespeare, and further that it was 
not by the same author or authors as Parts II. and III. 
Drake would have excluded this play altogether. 

The first champion of all these plays, and of the formation 
plays also (of Parts II. and III.) as Shakespeare's, was Knight. 
Knight's view has, I think, never been accepted by any one 
else. But he dealt with the whole subject at great length and 
with much critical ability, and by his means the questions at 
issue were removed from much of the early dogmatism they 
were tainted with. Since his time no one has ventured to deny 
Shakespeare's authorship, whose opinion carries weight ; al- 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xlvii 

though some, like Dyce (2nd ed.) thought that he merely 
slightly altered and improved an old drama in Henry F/. (Part I.)- 

For more lengthened opinions of these writers— as many 
more there be — I would refer to Grant White's excellent review 
of the position (vii. p. 403 et seq., ed. 1881); Collier's "mon- 
strous opinion" that Shakespeare wrote Part I., but had no 
hand in The Contention or The True Tragedy ; and also Halli- 
well's elaborate suggestion of " an intermediate composition " 
amongst these original dramas which complicates matters and 
is as ingenious as it is unwarranted. Dyce followed Hallam in 
avowing a strong suspicion that those two old dramas were 
wholly by Marlowe ! Perhaps the most extraordinary of all 
these imaginings. 

Fleay, Furnivall, Ingleby, and Miss Lee have endeavoured 
to allot accurately the parts in this play that are Shakespeare's 
to him, and the other parts to Marlowe, or to Peele or Greene 
as the case may be. They do not agree among themselves 
except in a general way as to what Shakespeare wrote un- 
doubtedly. Fleay would have Shakespeare's parts " of much 
later date, and inserted by him" — an unhappy guess. Dr. 
Ingleby is somewhat similar in his opinion. The very fact of 
there being no mention of Robert Greene in their views (nor 
in Furnivall's) puts them out of court in my opinion. 

The German critics, Gervinus, Schlegel, Tieck and Ulrici, and 
Verplanck generally accept this play as Shakespeare's, or 
mainly Shakespeare's, without labouring much as to who else 
is concerned. Gervinus, however, removes a quantity of the 
play from Shakespeare, regarding that which is his as insertions 
in order to " unite this first part most closely with the second 
and third, while before it had been totally unconnected with 
them." He labours the point (as Malone did) that the chief 
chronicler used was Hall not Holinshed, the latter being 
" Shakespeare's historian." Gervinus simply rejects what he 
does not think good enough for Shakespeare — what is in con- 
trast with his later mode and manner. He is very good 
reading, biit wholly unconvincing. I find in a footnote that 
he seems to attribute The Contention and The True Tragedy 
wholly to Greene. Gervinus differs from Schlegel, Tieck and 
Ulrici who regard the whole trilogy as undoubtedly Shake- 
speare's. Ward regards Part I. as having received "passages, 
d 



xlviii THE FIRST VAUT OF 

and even scenes " from Shakespeare's hand, as an adapter. 
Ward states positively, however, " that there is no evidence to 
identify Part I. of Henry VI. either with the Henry the VI. 
noted by Henslowe, or with the play alluded to by Nashe " — 
a dogmatic assertion which I can see no justification whatever 
for. Ward decides further that Parts II. and III, were elabor- 
ated by Shakespeare from those older plays which were written 
by some author unknown, which cannot be ascribed to authors 
of so distinct a style as Greene, or Marlowe, or Peele. He 
places Titus Andronicus in exactly the same position. 

The worst of these conflicting opinions is that they each 
carry with them a certain amount of conviction until the next 
is considered. There is no doubt Ward is emphatically right 
in saying that those plays cannot be lightly regarded as belong- 
ing to any of the three writers mentioned. This does not 
exclude a junta, but this discussion is out of place for the 
present. I will merely say that his argument that those plays 
cannot have been written by Shakespeare (expunging at once 
the other three authors) because of the changes made in the 
finished work (Parts II. and III.) seems lame and insufficient. 
We must regard Shakespeare as improving and developing at 
a most rapid rate. What would any of these three parts 
(admittedly by Shakespeare according to Ward) have turned 
out like if he handled them over again, a little, even a very 
little later ? 

I will now quote from Grant White, already referred to. 
His opinion is that : " The First Part of the Contention, The 
True Tragedy, and, probably, an early form of the first part 
of King Henry the VI., unknown to us, were written by Mar- 
lowe, Greene and Shakespeare (and perhaps Peele) together, 
not improbably as collaborators for the company known as the 
Earl of Pembroke's servants, soon after the arrival of Shake- 
speare in London ; and that he, in taking passages, and some- 
times whole scenes, from those plays for his King Henry the 
Sixth, did little more than to reclaim his own." Two remarks 
only will I hazard here, leaving the genesis of Parts II. and III. 
to unfold themselves at the proper time. One is why are we 
to add to our difficulties by supposing an earlier form of Part I. ? 
The part we have before us is the early form itself bearing 
evidence of more hands than Shakespeare's. The other is a 



KING HENRY THE SIXTH xlix 

warning not to accept this opinion, with regard to TJie True 
Tragedy at any rate, since practically, as we shall see, the whole 
of that play lies embedded in the third part ; and whoever 
wrote the one rewrote it into the other — almost without a 
doubt — or so nearly so that any other influence or co-operation 
is of the slightest. This cannot at all be said of The Contention 
and Part II. 

Mr. P. A. Daniel has summarised his time-analysis of this 
play as follows : " Time of this play eight days," with intervals. 
Day I, Act I. to Scene vi., Interval ; Day 2, Act II. to Scene v. ; 
Day 3, Act III. Scene i., Interval ; Day 4, Act III. Scene ii. ; 
Day 5, Act III. Scene iii., Interval ; Day 6, Act III. Scene iv., 
Act IV. Scene i.. Interval ; Day 7, Act IV. Scenes ii. to vii., and 
Act V. to Scene iii., Interval ; Day 8, Act V. Scenes iv. and v. 

Historic period, say from death of Henry V., 31st August, 
1422, to the treaty of marriage between Henry VI. and 
Margaret, end of 1444. 

A few notes on the text, as here given, and I have done. 
I had begun to efface " the apostrophes and so miss the 
accent," as Holofernes puts it, in such words as placed, faced, 
moved, instead of plac'd, fac'd mov'd ; when I was glad to find 
the Cambridge Shakespeare (2nd edition) gave me authority to 
do so. The removal of the note of admiration from O, to the 
end of the clause, has also been adopted. A longing to ob- 
literate hyphens by the host has been resisted. Neither in 
modern nor early editions has principle or uniformity been 
observed to fall in with. A ^q'^ more commas have been 
silently dropped. And the following original (or suggested) 
readings have been adopted ; —

The Introductions to the three Parts are so dependent upon 
one another, that none of them can be regarded as a separate 
whole. 

I am very anxious here to say a word, which is also pain- 
fully difficult to me to say, on a subject always present in my 
thoughts and especially while at work at these editions of 
Shakespeare's plays. I refer to the death of our general editor, 
my old, long-tried and most highly valued friend William J. 
Craig. It is needless but very pleasurable to dwell upon his 
never-failing courtesy and tact — his unselfish and never withheld 
advice and assistance as well as his continued resourcefulness in 
matters Shakespearian, the chiefest labours of his love. All 
who knew him knew these things in him. In teaching me 
how to love Shakespeare thirty or more years ago he taught 
me how to love himself, and but for him my life perhaps would 
have been void of a prolonged joy. Whether we joined in a 
midnight foray on the Wicklow mountains, or on Dodsley's old 
plays, in those old Trinity days, he was always the most lov- 
able and sociable of companions — and to the very end the ties 
between us never slackened — grappled with hoops of steel. 
Always broad-minded, and kind-hearted, always loyal, he leaves 
a gap amongst his mourning friends that they can only be 
thankful his presence once filled so full, while knowing it must 
now for ever remain empty save in the sweetness of memory 
and the knowledge of the beneficence of his influence.

THE FIRST PART OF 
KING HENRY THE SIXTH 



ACT I 

SCENE \.— Westminster Abbey. 

Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KiNG HENRY the Fifth, 
attended on by the DUKE OF BEDFORD, Regent of Fraftce ; 
the Duke of Gloucester, Protector; the Duke of 
Exeter, the Earl of Warwick, the Bishop of Win- 
chester, Heralds, &c.

minster Abbey] Theobald. Fifth] Fift F i, Fifth F 4. Heralds, &€.] 
Malone ; and the Duke of Somerset. Ff. 



I. Hung . . . black'] The stage was 
draped with black for a tragedy. 
Steevens quotes Sidney, Arcadia, bk. 
ii. (p. 229, vol. ii. ed. 1739) : " There 
arose even with the sun, a vail of dark 
clouds before his face, which shortly, 
like ink poured into water, had blacked 
over all the face of heaven, preparing 
as it were a mournfull stage for a 
tragedy to be played on." Malone 
refers to Marston's Insatiate Countess 
(1613), IV. V. 4-7 :— 

"The stage of heaven is hung with 
solemn black, 
A time best fitting to act tragedies. 
The night's great queen, that 

maiden governess. 
Musters black clouds to hide her 
from the world." 
Compare too A Warning for Faire 
Women, 1599 (Simpson's School of 
Shakespeare, ii. 244): — 

" Look, Comedy, I mark'd it not till 
now, 



The stage is hung with black, and 

I perceive 
The auditors prepar'd for Tragedy." 
I do not believe there is any reference 
here to the word in Cotgrave ; if it 
ever had general use it was at a later 
date. Cotgrave has " Valerie. A 
robberie, . . . also a place over a stage 
which we call the Heaven" (16 ri). 
Malone made the suggestion. For 
the structure of this line, see note at 
I. vi. 2. 

2. Comets] "These blazing starres the 
Greekes call Cometas, our Romanes 
Crinitas : dreadfull to be scene. . . . 
As for those named Acontias, they 
brandish and shake like a speare or 
dart . . . these be blazing starres that 
become all shaggie, compassed round 
with hairie fringe. ... A fearefull 
starre for the most part this Comet is, 
and not easily expiated " (Holland's 
Plinic, bk. ii. ch. xxv.). New Eng. Diet. 
quotes Complaint of Scotland (vi. 1872), 



THE Fll^ST PAirr OF

Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky, 
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars 
That have consented unto Henry's death 1 
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long ! 
England ne'er lost a king of so much worth. 
G/ot4. England ne'er had a king until his time. 
Virtue he had, deserving to command : 
His bi-andish'd sword did blind men with his beams ; 
His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings ; 
His sparkling eyes, replete with wrathful fire, 
More dazzled and drove back his enemies 
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces. 
What should I say ! his deeds exceed all speech : 



lo 



15 



1549: " Ane stearre . . . callit ane 
comeit ; quhen it is sene, ther occurris 
haistyly efter it sum gut. myscheif." 
Greene often refers to the superstition : 
" like the elevation of a Commct which 
foreshewes ever some fatall and finall 
ruine" {Penelopes Web (Grosart, v. 
175). 1587). And in Mamillia (Grosart, 
ii. 150), 1583 : " his foes contrariwise 
conjecturing the worst, said that his 
pompous prodigalitie and rich attire 
were the two blazing starres and care- 
full comets which did alwaies prog- 
nosticate some such event." Common 
in later plays. And see Spenser's 
Fabric Queene, in. i. i6, where Upton's 
note gives classical references. Cam- 
den tells of one in 1582. See line 55 
below, note. 

3. Brandish] flash and glitter like a 
brandished sword. See quotation from 
Holland's Piinie at line 2. New Ertff. 
Diet, has " Brandysh, or glytter, like a 
sword, eorusco" (Huloet, 1552). And 
Sylvester's Dii Bart as : — 

" Thine eyes already (now no longer 

eyes ; 
But new bright stars) do brandish 

in the skyes." 

3. crystal] bright, clear. Often used 
in connection with the skies. Compare 
"the heaven crystalline " in the old 
Taming^ of a Shrew {Six Old Plays, p. 
igo), 1594. A similar expression occurs 
in Marlowe's Tamburlaine, Part I. v. : 
" Flora in her morning's pride, shaking 
her silver tresses in the air." The 
reader is at once reminded of Marlowe 
by these opening lines. 

4. revolting] rebellious. A favourite 
word in Shakespeare. 

5. consented unto] agreed with, acted 



in concert. See Richard II. i. ii. 25. 
Lat. Conceiitus (Steevens). Compare 
Golding"s Ovid, bk. xi. lines 78, 79 : 
" The Thracian women . . . As many 
fas consenting to this wicked act were 
ound." 

10. brandish'd] See note at line 3. 
Spenser has "his brandisht blade" 
{Faerie Queene, 11. xi. 37). 

11. dragon's wings] Compare Troilus 
and Cressida, v. viii. 17. " That old 
dragon " that the Redcross knight slays 
in Spenser's Faerie Queene was in 
Shakespeare's mind: " Then, with his 
waving wings displayed wide" (i. xi. 
18); 

" His blazmg eyes . . . 

Did burn with wrath and sparkled 

living fire, 
As two broad Beacons . . . 
. . . warning give that enemies 

conspyre " (st. xiv.). 

12. replete with] full of. Compare 
The true Tragedic 0/ Richard Duke of 
Yorke (Shaks. Library, Hazlitt, p. 85), 
1592 : " Thy lookes are all repleat with 
Majestie"; and The Troublesome 
Raigne of King John (Shaks. Library, 
Hazlitt, p. 316), 1591 : " My life repleat 
with rage and tyranie." And see 2 
Henry VI. i. i. 20, and 3 Henry VI. in. 
ii. 84. The expression occurs only in 
Shakespeare's earliest work, especially 
in the historical plays. It is not un- 
common earlier. See Hawes' Pastime of 
Pleasure, 1509 {passim). 

14. fierce] U.sed adverbially again in 
Henry V. 11. iv. g. 

15. What should I say I] it is hope- 
less. Compare Golding's Ovid, bk. ii. 
240, 245 : " What should he doe ? . . . 
He wist not what was best to doe, his

KING HENUV THE SIXTH 



He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered. 
Exe. We mourn in black : why mourn we not in blood ? 

Henry is dead and never shall revive. 

Upon a wooden coffin we attend, 

And death's dishonourable victory 20 

We with our statel)' presence glorify, 

Like captives bound to a triumphant car. 

What! shall wc curse the planets of mishap 

That plotted thus our _i;lor)''s overthrow? 

Or shall wc think the subtle-witted h'rench 25 

Conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him, 

By magic verses have contriv'd his end ? 
Win. He was a king bless'd of the King of kings. 

Unto the French the dreadful judgment-day 

So dreadful will not be as was his sight. 30 

The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought : 

The church's prayers made him so prosperous. 
Glou. The church ! where is it ? had not churchmen pray'd 

His thread of life had not so soon decay'd : 



wittes were ravisht so" (1567). And 
Grafton's Chronicle, 1569 (reprint 1S09, 
i. 574), Henry the Sixt : " What should 
I suyf, the Captaines on horsebacke 
came to the gate and the Traytors 
within slue the porters and vvatchemen 
and let in their friendes." Often in 
Hall and Crrafton. 

16. lift] lifted. Common in early 
writers: " they drewe foorth, and lift 
Joseph out of the pit " (Genesis x.xxvii. 
28, Geneva Bible, altered in modern 
text). And Greene, A Looking Glasse 
for London (Grosart, xiv. 29, line 

553):— 

" And when I trac't upon the tender 
grass. 
Love, that makes warme the center 

of the earth. 
Lift up his crest to kisse Remilia's 
foote." 
And Peele, David and Bcthsabe : 
" Hath fought like one whose arms 
were lift by heaven " (468). 

17. mourn . . . in blood] Compare 
" mourn in steel " (5 Henry VL i. i. 
58). 

19. Z£»oo</fH] senseless, expressionless, 
unfeeling. The extended sense gives 
some colour to the line. See " that's a 
wooden thing" (v. iii. 89). Suffolk's 
contemptuous expression for the king. 
Compare Greene's Orpharion (Grosart, 
xii. 17), 1588-9 : " or fayre without wit, 
and that is to marry a wooddeji picture 



with a golden creast, full of favour but 
flattering." 

23. planets of mishap] An expression 
of Greene's: " Borne underneathe the 
Planet of mishap " (Alphonsus, King of 
Arragon, Grosart, xiii. 391). 

26. Conjurer] a magician ; one who 
has to do with spirits. So in Part II. 
I. ii. 76. " Roger Bolingbroke the 
conjurer " is a nigromancer in the 
Chronicles. And compare Comedy of 
Errors, Acts iv. and v. "A Ballad of 
the life and deathe of Doctor Faustus 
the Cunngerer" (Stationers' Register, 
15S9). Sacrapant in The Old Wives 
Tale (Peele) is a conjurer. 

27. magic verses] Compare Faerie 
Queene, i. ix. 48 : — 

" All his manly powres it did dis- 
perse, 
As he were charmed with in- 

chaunted rimes: 

That oftentimes he quaked, and 

fainted oftentimes." 

34. thread of life] Again in 2 Henry 

VL iv. ii. 31, and Pericles, i. ii. 108. 

Compare Golding's Ovid, ii. 81S, 819 

(1567):- 

" And in the latter end 
The fatall dames shall breake thy 
threcde." 
Without any direct reference to theFates, 
compare (Peele's) yack Straw (Hazlitt's 
Dodsley, v. 409): "When thread of 
life is almost fret in twain."

KTXG HENRY THE SIXTH 



Enter a Messenger. 

Mess. My honourable lords, health to you all ! 

Sad tidings brin;^ 1 to )'ou f)Ut of l-Vance, 

Of loss, of slaughter, and discomfiture: 

Guienne, Chanipaigne, Rheims, Orleans, 6o 

Paris, Guj'sors, Poictiers, all are ijuite lost. 
Bed. What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse? 

Speak soft!}', or the loss of those great towns 

Will make him burst his lead and rise from death. 
GloH. Is Paris lost? is Roan )-ieided up? 65 

If Henry were recall'd to life again 

These news would cause him once more yield the ghost. 
Exe. How were they lost ? what treachery was us'd ? 
Mess. No treachery, but want of men and money. 

Amongst the soldiers this is muttered, 70 

65. 15 Roaii\ F I ; and is Roan Ff 2,3,4; Ro^cn Cambridge. 



. . , She no sooner let it flye, 
But that a goodly shyning starre it 

up a loft did stye 
And drew a greate way after it 

bryght beanies like burning 

lieare." 
The mention of hair shows that the 
comet is referred to again. Plutarch 
says " there was a great comet which 
seven nights together was seen very 
bright after Caesar's death." See note 
in Arden edition to yuliiis Ccesar, u. ii. 
31. And see more in Holland's Plinie, 
bk. ii. ch. XXV. : " By that starre it was 
signified (as the common sort beleeved) 
that the soule of lulius Ca;sar was 
received among the divine powers of 
the immortal gods." That the above 
account in Golding of Cajsar's constella- 
tion was familiar to Shakespeare is 
evident from the account of the '• warn- 
ings of the Gods" before the murder 
(lines 879-95). They supply the 
"battles feyghting in the clowdes," 
" the rain of blood," the " gastly 
spryghts" ofy»/u/s Ca-sar, 11. ii. 12-25. 
56. or bright — ] M. Mason says, 
" Pope's conjecture is confirmed by this 
peculiar circumstance, that two blazing 
stars (the ytilium Sidus) are part of the 
arms of the Drake family." And Malone 
rightly affirms that this blank arose 
from the transcriber or compositor 
not being able to make out the name. 
The rhyme is the chief argument in 
favour of Drake, which is however very 
unacceptable of a then-living man. 



64. U-ad] the lining or inner shell of 
the wooden coffin. Compare Beaumont 
and Fletcher's Knight of Malta, iv. ii. : 
'^[They remove the coffin, lift Oriana 
out of it, and then put it back into 
the monument.] . . . Mir. Softly good 
friend ; take her into your arms. Nor. 
Put in the crust again." The "crust" 
here is the lapping of lead mentioned 
in The Passionate Pilgrim, xxi. 391-95. 
See too Middleton's A Mad World, my 
Masters, 11. ii. : " let him trap me in 
gold, and I'll lap him in lead." With- 
out a knowledge of this a passage in 
The Merchant of Venice, 11. vii. 49-51 
loses its force. Marlowe gives : " Not 
lapt in lead but in a sheet of gold " 
(Tamburlaine, pt. ii., end of Act ii.). 
" Wrapt in lead," meaning dead, occurs 
twice in Spenser's Shepheards Calendar 
(June and October), 1579. 

67. cause him . . . yield] For "to" 
omitted after "cause," compare Greene, 
George-a-Greene (at the end) : " Whose 
fathers he cans d murthered in those 
warres." 

70. this is muttered] Grafton has here 
(i. 562) : " the Duke of Bedford openly 
rebuked the Lordes in general!, because 
that they in the time of warre, through 
their privie malice and inwarde grudge, 
had almost moved the people to warre 
and commocion, in which time all men 
should . . . serve and dread their sove- 
raigne Lorde King Henry, in perform- 
ing his conquest in Fraunce, which was 
in maner brought to conclusion."

and artistic ornament probably repre- 
senting the Iris. " Iris, this herbe is 
called Floure-delyce " (R. Banckes ? 
Heiball, Sig. D, ii. 30, 1525). As a 
part of England's coat, Grafton says : 
" Ihon Rastall sayth in his chronicle 
that it is not lyke to be true that the 
great Hall of Westminster that is now, 
was buylded by this king, but rather in 
the tyme of King Richarde the Second. 
For sayth he, the Armes that are there 
both on the timber and on the stone 
worke, which is the three Lyons quar- 
tered with the flower de luce, and the 
white Hart for his badge, were the 
armes of King Richard. For there was 
never king of England that gave the 



flower de luce which was the armes of 
Fraunce before King Edward the 
thirde " (i. 176). 

81. coat] coat of arms. " Your arms 
of England's coat" is equivalent to 
"your English coat of arms," spoken 
by a foreign messenger who already 
uses English nobility in a foreign 
manner. The punctuation should not 
be altered from the old edition. 

83. her flowing tides] England's 
flowing tides (.Malone). The prosaic 
alteration of Theobald's is gladly re- 
jected. A similar quibble (tide, tied) 
is in Lyly's Endymion, iv. ii. 

85. steeled coat] coat of mail. Not

THE FIRST PART OF 



[act 



Haviiii:^ full scarce six thousand in his troop. 
By thrce-and-twenty thousand of the French 
Was round encompassed and set upon. 
No leisure had he to enrank his men ; 
He wanted pikes to set before his archers ; 

112. full scarce] Ff; scarce full Kovve. 



115 



112. full] fully, in full, altogether. 
Full is very often " pl.iced emphatic- 
ally " (Schmidt) before adjectives and 
adverbs by Shakespeare. The sense 
varies with the following word. Here 
it means "all told." See iv. i. 20. 
Compare "full resolved" in Peele's 
Edjcard I. : " Edward is full resolved of 
thy faith" (387, b) ; an expression oc- 
curring in Titus Andronicus and Two 
Gentlemen of Verona. And see below, 
" full replete " (v. v. 17). 

115. enrank] place in ranks. Not 
found earlier. 

116. He wanted pikes to set before 
his archers] The archers carried stakes, 
or the other footmen carried them for 
them, to set in the ground before the 
former to keep off the enemy's horse. 
A few passages from Grafton's Chronicle 
(1569) of these wars will illustrate this. 
" The Uuke of Bedford, not ignoraunt 
howe to order his men, made likewise 
an entier batayle, and suffered no man 
to be on horseback and set the archers 
(every one having a sharpe stake) both 
in the front of the battayle, and on the 
sides lyke wings, and behinde the 
battayle were the pages with the 
charlottes and cariages, and all the 
horses were tyed together either with 
the reins of their bridles or by the 
tayles" (i. 556, reprint, 1809). This 
was a " pitched field." The chronicler 
continues : " The French men at the 
first sight remembering howe often 
times in pitched fieldes they had bene 
overcome . . . began somewhat to feare. 
. . . The french horsemen that daye 
did little service : for the archers so 
galled their horses, that they desyred 
not muche to approch their presence." 
This battle (Patay) was fought the xxvij 
day of August, 1425, and was a great 
victory for the English. And again (p. 
578) : " Wherefore Sir John Fastolfe 
and his Companions set all their copanie 
in good order of Battaile, and pitched 
stakes before every Archer to breake 
the force of the horsemen. At their 
backes they set all their wagons and 
cariages . . . and in this maner they 



stood still, abiding the assault of their 
adversaries. . . . This conllict (because 
the most part of the cariage was 
Herynge and Lenten stuffe) the French- 
men call the unfortunate battaile of 
Herynges." The next passage deals 
with the events before us in the play. 
It was a surprise. " The lorde Talbote 
with five thousand men, was coming to 
Meum. . . . The Englishe men comming 
forwarde perceyued the [French] horse- 
men, and imagining to deceyue their 
enemies, commanded the footemen to 
environe and enclose themselues about 
with their stakes, but the french 
horsemen came on so fiercely that the 
archers had no leysure to set themselues 
in aray. There was no rcmedie, but 
to fight at adventure. This battayle 
continued by the space of three long 
houres. And although the Englishe 
men were overpresscd with the number 
of their adversaries, yet they never fled 
back one foote, till their Captayne the 
Lorde Talbot was sore wounded at the 
backe, and so was taken . . . there 
were slayne about twelve hundred, and 
taken xl. Whereof the Lorde Talbot, 
the Lorde Scales, the Lorde Hungerford 
and Sir Thomas Rampstone were the 
chiefe. . . . From this battayle de- 
parted without any stroke striken, Syr 
John Fastolfe, the same yere for his 
valyauntnesse elected into the order of 
the Garter : For which cause the Duke 
of Bedford in a great anger toke from 
hym the Image of Saint George, and 
his Garter : but afterward, by meane 
of friends, and apparaunte causes of 
good excuse by him alleged, he was re- 
stored to the order agayne. agaynst the 
minde of the Lorde Talbot" (page 
582, Grafton). It will be seen that this 
lengthy note supplies much information. 
F'astolfe " without any stroke striken," 
the three hours' fight, and Talbot 
wounded sore in the back, are all 
dealt with, as well as the stakes to 
break the force of the horsemen. See 
in. i. 103 for Fastolfe's cowardice 
again. 

116. pikes] The exact signification 



sc. I] KING HENRY THE SIXTH 



11 



Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hiciges 

They pitched in the ground confusedly, 

To keep the horsemen off from breaking in. 

More than tiiree hours the fight continued ; 120 

VViiere vaHant I'albot above liuman thought 

Enacted wonders with his sword and lance. 

Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him ; 

Here, there, and every where, enraged he slew : 

The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms; 125 

All the whole army stood agazed on him. 

His soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit, 

A Talbot ! a Talbot ! cried out amain, 

And rush'd into the bowels of the battle. 

Here had the conquest fully been .seal'd up, 1 30 



124. slew] Ff ; Jie-iV Rowe (ed. 2), Cambridge, Craig. 



here is needful to explain a line in 
Greene's Fritr Bacon and Frier Bungay 
(Grosart, xiii. ib2) : — 

" But then the stormy threats of war 

shall cease : 
The horse shall stavipe as careUzse 

of the pike. 
Drums shall be turn'd to timbrels of 

delight." 
These pikes ("stakes bound with yron 
sharpe at both the ends of the length of 
V. or vj. foote, to be pitched before the 
Archers ... so that the footemen 
were hedged about ") were first devised 
and practised by that wise and politic 
prince (Henry tfie Fifth) at Agincourt 
(Grafton, pp. 516-517). 

121. valiant Talbot] Grafton's words 
on Talbot are (p. 574) : " This ioly 
Capteyn & sonne of the \aliant Mars 
. . . which Lord Talbot, beyng both 
of noble birth and haute courage, after 
his commyng into Fraunce, obteyned 
so many glorious victories of hys 
enimies that his only name was, and 
3'et is, dreadfull to the French nacion, 
and much renoumed amongst all other 
people." See notes at i. iv. 42 and 

II. i. 79. 

124. Here, there, and every where] 
Occurs again, in Troihts and Crcssida, 
V. V. 26. Also in the Faerie Queene, 

III. i. 66: — 

" Here, there, and everywhere, about 
her sway'd 
Her wrathfull Steele." 
And again, in. xi. 28. 

124. s/^Zi'] The alteration to" flew" is 
unbearable and unwarrantable. "Slay," 



used absolutely, is a fine expression. 
Compare yuliiis Ccesar, in. ii. 209. 

126. agazed] astounded, amazed. 
Probably an old form of aghast. New 
Eng. Diet, gives examples from Chester 
Plays {c. 1400), and Surrey's Poems, 
1557. Surrey affected Chaucerian lan- 
guage. 

127. undaunted spirit] See again 
for these words, in. ii. 99 and v. v. 
70. Marlowe uses this in Edward III. 
(Dyce, p. 184, b) : " Th' undaunted 
spirit of Percy was appeas'd." 

128. A Talbot t a Talbot]The name 
of the leader, coupled with St. George, 
was the usual battle-cry. So in Graf- 
ton : " And in lyke maner the Duke of 
Bedford encouraged his people, and 
foorthwith they gave the onset upon 
their enimies, crying, Saint George, 
Bedford" (p. 557). And again (p. 
561); "the Englishe men came out 
... by the gate of the towne, cryeng 
Saint George, Salisburie : and set 
on their enimies both before and be- 
hinde." And again (p. 575) : " About 
sixe of the clock in the morning they 
issued out of the Castell, cryeng Saint 
George, Talbot." 

129. bowels of the battle]CompaTe iv. 
vii. 42 below, and Coriolanus, iv. v. 136. 
" Bowels of the earth " {1 Henry IV. i. 
iii. 61) occurs in Golding's Ovid, i. 
156. 

130. seaVd up] brought to a deter- 
mination, made perfect. Compare 
Greene, Frier Bacon and Frier Bungay 
(Grosart, xiii. 41) : " Then go to bed 
and seal up your desires."

THE FIRST PART OF 



[act I, 



If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward. 
Ho, being in the vavvard, plac'd behind 
With purpose to reh'c\e and follow them, 
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke. 
Hence grew the general wrack and massacre : 135 

Enclosed were they with their enemies. 
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace, 
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back ; 
Whom all France, with their chief assembled strength. 
Durst not presume to look once in the face. 140 

Bed. Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself, 
For living idly here in pomp and ease 
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid, 
Unto his dastard foemen is betray 'd.

131. Fastolfe . . . played the coward] 
See note at line 116, and see below, iii. 
ii. 103-g. Sir John Fastolfe appears 
to have satisfactorily disproved their 
charge of cowardice, upon his return 
home. His honours were restored to 
him and he served the King at home as 
a member of the Priv)- Council. Nor 
is there any reference to these accusa- 
tions in his claims against the King for 
various losses in 1455. Nevertheless 
he was an object of aversion to the 
populace who held him partly account- 
able for the loss of Normandy, and 
Cade had him proclaimed as "the 
greatest traitor in England or France." 
He died at Caister in Norfolk on the 
5th November, 1459. F"or an ample 
account of him see Gairdner's Intro- 
duction to the Paston Letters, vol. i., 
and the Letters themselves. His ap- 
pointment to the wars is mentioned as 
follows by Grafton : " After this victory 
['The Battle of Crauant'] . . . the Re- 
gent . . . constituted the Erie of Salis- 
burie (as he was wel worthy) Vicegerent 
and Lieutenant for the king and him 
in the Countries of Fraunce, Bry and 
Champaine, and Sir John Fastolfe he 
substituted Deputie under him in the 
Duchie of Normandie on this side of 
the river of Seyne and with that he 
deputed him governor of the Countries 
of Anjow and Mayne" (i. 552, 553). 

132. in the vaward]\n the vanguard. 
Compare Coriolanus, i. vi. 53. Fastolfe 



was in support (placed behind) of the 
vanguard, which was probably led by 
Talbot himself. The passage has 
raised objections, but somebody had to 
be foremost. In Greene's Euphues His 
Censure to Philautits (Grosart, vi. 276) 
" Clytomaches, whose courage no perill 
could daunt . . . for proofe of his 
owne resolution, was foremost in the 
vawarde." 

132. plac'd behind] A military use, 
posted, stationed, as in iii. ii. 127. So 
in Grafton, Chronicle, i. 296 : " plant- 
yng and placyng men of warre in sundrie 
Castels and Townes." See Much Ado 
About Nothinp;, in. iii. 159. 

133. With purpose] on purpose, de- 
signedly. Compare Merchant of Venice, 

I. i. 91, and Kinf; John, v. vii. 86. 
137. Wallooyi] an inhabitant of the 

border country between the Netherlands

Jack Straw : " We are here four cap- 
tains just, Jack Straw, Wat Tyler, Hob 
Carter and Tom Miller : Search me 
all England and find four such captains 
and by Gog's blood I '11 be hanged" 
(Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 386). And Peele,

(Grafton, i. 575, 1427). 

175. Jack out of officc'\ An old 
phrase occurring in Heywood's Pro-

"And jackc out of office she may 

bid me walke, 
And thinke me as wise as Wal- 

tham's calfe, to talke." 
Sharman quotes from Rich's Fare^vell 
to Militarie Profession, 1581 : " For 
liberalitie is tourned Jacke out of office, 
and others appointed to have the 
custodie." Heywood has it again in 
Epigrams upon Proverbs, 1562. 

176. The king] See quotation at i. iii. 
70. This charge forms Item 2 of Glou- 
cester's Accusations : " my sayde Lorde

or of the King's counsayle, purposed and

176. Eltham] Mentioned again, iii. i. 
156. A favourite palace of the early 
kings of England down to the reign of 
Henry VIII., when it began to yield in 
importance to Greenwich. It was much 
frequented by Elizabeth and James for 
hunting and the healthy air of Kent. 
" As for tythyngs here, the Kyng is 
way at Eltham and at Grenewych to hunt 
and to sport hym there, byding the 
Parlement, and the Quene and the 
Prynce byth in Walys alway. And is

177. sit at chiefest stern] be in the 
chiefest place of guidance of public 
affairs. Stern is rudder. It occurs in 
this sense in Whetstone's Promos and 
Cassandra, part i. (p. ii. Six Old 
Plays) : "I am the stern that guides 
their thoughts." 

177. public weal] A standard expres-

iii. 189. It is in Golding's Ovid (iv. 
258, 259): " rulde the publike weal Of

here. The passage is in " To the 
Reader " prefixed to Have with you to 
Saffron IVnlden (Grosart's Nashe, iii. 
28), 1596 : " Nay, then, ^sopum non 
attriuistis, you are as ignorant in the 
true movings of my Muse as the 
Astronomers are in the true movings 
of Mars, which to this day they could 
never attaine too." It was the motions 
of Mars, watched for many long years 
by Tycho Brahe, and studied for 
twenty years by Kepler, which enabled 
the latter, in 1609, to complete his 
labours and lead the planet captive. 

6. we lie near Orleans] "After this 
[see note at line 171] in the Moneth of 
September, he [Salisbury] layde his 
siege on the one side of the water of 
Loyre and besieged the towne of 
Orleaunce, before whose comming, the 
Bastard of Orleaunce, and the Byshop 
of the Citie and a great number of 
Scottes hering of the Erles intent, made 
divers fortifications about the towne, 
and destroyed the suburbes, in the 
which were xij Parishe Churches, and 
foure orders of Friers. They cut also 
downe all the vines, trees and bushes 
within five leagues of the towne, so 
that the Englishe men should have 



neyther comfort, refuge, nor succour " 
(Grafton, i. 576). 

7. pale ghosts] See note at raw-boned, 
line 35. 

8. Faintly] feebly, weakly. Com- 
pare Tamburlatne, Part I. ii. i : " With 
unwilling soldiers/aiwi/y arm'd " (Dyce, 
13. b). 

g. porridge] Compare Nashe, Fourc 
Letters Confuted (Grosart, ii. 285), 
1592: " Amongst all other stratagems 
and puissant engins, what say you to 
Mates Pumpe in Cheapside, to pumpe 
over mutton and porridge into Fraunce ? 
this colde weather our souldiers, I can 
tell you, have need of it, and, poore 
field mise, they have almost got the 
colicke and stone with eating of pro- 
vant." A suggestive parallel. See 
lines II, 12. 

9. They want their . . . bull-beeves] 
To eat bull beef was supposed to con- 
fer courage. The expression had a 
proverbial use. Thus Gascoigne, An 
Apologie of the School of Abuse (Arber, 
p. 64), 1579 : " They have eaten bulbief, 
and threatned highly, too put water 
in my woortes, whensoever they catche 
me ; I hope it is but a coppy of their 
countenance. Ad diem fortasse mini- 
tantur. Shrewde kyne shall have shorte 
homes." And Nashe, Preface to Sid- 
ney's Asfrophel and Stella (Arber's 
English Garner, i. 500), 1591 : " they 
bear out their sails as proudly as if 
they were ballasted with bull beef." 
" To look as if he had eaten bull-beef" 
is in Ray's Proverbs (ed. 1678).

And pale of hew like a drouned

{Colyn Blowbres Testament{circa 1500), 
Hazlitt's Early Popular Poetry, i. 93). 
And Udall's Erasmus, 1542 (Robert's

of the gate of the bridge and fought 
with the Englishmen, but they receyued 
him with so fierce and terrible strokes 
that he was with al his company com- 
pelled to retire and flie back into the 
Citie : but the Englishe men folowed 
them so fast, in kylling and taking of 
their enemies, that they entered with 
them the Bulwarke of the bridge : 
which with a great Towre standing at 
the ende of the same, was taken in- 
continent by the English men. In 
which conflict many French men were 
taken, but mo were slaine, and the 
keeping of the Towre and Bulwarke 
was committed to Wylliam Glasdale, 
Esquire" (Grafton, i. 577).

He fighteth as one weary of his life : 

The other lords, like lions wanting food, 

Do rush upon us as their hungry prey. 
Alen. Froissart, a countryman of ours, records, 

England all Olivers and Rowlands bred 30 

During the time Edward the Third did reign. 

More truly now may this be verified ; 

For none but Samsons and Goliascs 

It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten ! 

Lean raw-boned rascals ! who would e'er suppose 35 

They had such courage and audacity ? 
Cha. Let 's leave this town ; for they are hare-brain'd slaves, 

27. The\ F I ; To Ff 2, 3, 4. 30. bred] Rowe ; breed Ff. 37. LcVs . . . 
slaves\ two lines in Ff. 37. hare-brained] hair-brained Ff. 



25. homicide] manslayer. Only in 
this play and Richard III. and (cor- 
ruptly) in 2 Henry IV., in Shake- 
speare : but in early use. 

28. hungry prey] prey for their 
hunger. Compare wondrous praise, 
V. iii. igo (praise of her wondrous 
virtues). A common and often per- 
plexing kind of passage in Shakespeare. 
The hungry lion is perhaps more 
commonly met with in Shakespeare 
than in any other volume, excepting 
the Bible. 

30. Olivers and Rowlands] The two 
selected ones of Charlemagne's twelve 
peers or knights, commonly pitted 
against each other as exponents of 
deeds of derring-do. Greene brings 
them all on the stage in Orlando 
Furioso, but these two and Turpin 
(not Dick) and Ogier alone have parts. 
The others are merely " Gibson girls." 
Ben Jonson speaks of" All the mad Ro- 
lands and sweet Olivers" in his Exe- 
cration upon Vulcan. Hailiwell quoted 
from Hall, Henry VI. f. 64 : " But to 
have a Roland to resist an Oliver, he 
sent solempne ambassadors to the 
Kyng of England." "A Rowland for 
an Oliver," "mad Rowland," and 
" sweet Oliver," were common say- 
ings. 

33. Goliases] Compare Nashe, Have 
with you, etc. (Grosart, iii. 125), 1596 : 
"wheretoo, the other (beeing a big 
boand lustie fellow, and a Golias, or 
Behemoth, in comparison of him)." 

34. to skir7nish]toh3itt\e. "Skirmish" 
had a more serious import than it has 
now. Compare Greene, Euphues His 



Censure (Grosart, vi. 254), 1587 : "the 
skirmish furiously begun continuing for 
the space of three houres, with great 
massacre and bloodshed, fell at last on 
Ortellius side." And Holland's Plinie 
(1601), viii. 7: " Anniball forced those 
captives whom he had taken of our 
men, to skirmish one against another 
to the utterance." Common earlier as 
in Lord Berner's Froissart. 

35. raw-boned] skeleton-like. Nashe 
uses the term in Lenten Stuffe : " Any 
simple likelihood or rawbond carcase 
of a reason " (Grosart, v. 287). And 
again in Christes Teares over Jerusalem 
(Grosart, iv. 103), 1593: "So many 
men as were in Jerusalem, so many 
pale razvbone ghosts you would have 
thought you had scene." See " pale 
ghosts," line 7, above. Spenser has 
" rawbone armes " and " rawbone 
cheekes " in Faerie Qncene (i. viii. 41 
and I. ix. 35) earlier. 

35. rascals] lean, worthless deer, not 
worth killing. Compare 1 Henry IV. 
II. iv. 383 ; As You Like It, iii. iii. 58 ; 
diViACoriolanus, i. i. 163. 

37. hare-brain'd] Occurs again in 
1 Henry IV. v. ii. ig. This is the 
spelling in Hall's Chronicle, Henry V. 
(1548), the earliest example in New 
Eng. Diet. " As wood as a hare " 
occurs in Chaucer's Frere's Tale, and 
"as mad as a March hare" was very 
common from about 1500 onwards. 
Some support for " hair " may be found 
in the old saying, " more hair than 
wit." " Hairbrdind head" and a 
" hairbrainde blab " are found in Geld- 
ing's Ovid (1567).

or old I know them ; rather with their teeth 
The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege. 

Reig. I think, by some odd gimmors or dev-ice

Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do : 
By my consent, we'll even let them alone.

45 



38. eager] fierce. See 3 Henry VI. 
I. iv. 3. See Hawes' Pastime of Plea- 
sure : "He was as egre as grype or 
lyon." 

41. gimmors] A corruption of gim- 
mals, a pair ot rings or other hinged 
arrangements jointed together. Com- 
pare Holland's Plinie (1601), xxxiii. i. 
p. 45S : " Every joint . . . must have 
some lesser rings and gemmals to fit 
them." The singular is rare, but it 
occurs in Greene's Menaphon (Grosart, 
vi. 140), 1589 : " Such simplicitie was 
used, sayes the old women of our time, 
when a ring of a rush woulde tye as 
much love together as a Gimmor [mis- 
printed Gimmon] of golde." Nashe 
has it simply gims (" hookes and 
gymmes " of a gate) in Christes Teares 
(Grosart, iv. 91). Nares gives an ex- 
ample from Bishop Hall (quoted by 
Todd): "Who knows not how the 
famous Kentish idol moved her eyes 
and hands, by those secret gimmers 
which now every puppet play can 
imitate " (area 1650?). Dekker gives 
a good parallel in The Ravens Alman- 
acke (Grosart, iv. 232), 1609: "The 
vsurer had aclocke in his house, which 
went with such vices and gimmals, 
that by letting downe a pullie, he 
coulde make it strike what a clocke 
himselfe would ... he went himselfe 
and straind the pullie, and the clocke 
presently struck three." None of these 
examples (except Nashe's) are in New 
Eng. Diet., where ample explanatory 
information is given, with many quota- 
tions. Dekker is so exactly to the 
point that he is somewhat " suspect." 
Gim (? gimcrack) is in use in the north 
of Ireland for any trifling or ingenious 
little knick-knack. 

43. fuild out] last, endure. See 2 



Henry IV. iv. iv. 117 and Part HI. 11. 
vi. 24. Compare (Peele's) Jack Straw 
(Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 393) : " We cap- 
taines are Lords within ourselves, and 
if the world hold out, we shall be 
kings shortly." 

45. Enter the Bastard of Orleans] 
" Here must I a little digresse, and de- 
clare to you, what was this Bastard of 
Orleaunce which was not only now 
Capitayne of the Citie, but also after by 
Charles the Sixt, made Erie of Dunoys, 
and in great aucthoritie in Fraunce, and 
extreme enemie to the Englishe nation 
. . . Lewes Duke of Orleaunce . . . 
was owner of the Castell of Coney . . . 
whereof he made Constable the lord of 
Cawny, a man not so wise as his wife 
was faire, & yet she was not so faire, 
but she was as well beloued of the Duke 
of Orleaunce as of her husband . . . 
she concejoied a child, & brought forth 
a pretie boy called lohn. . . . The next 
of the kinne to my Lorde Cawny, chal- 
enged the enheritaunce alleging that 
the boy was a bastard . . . the chylde 
came to the age of ey ght yeres olde. At 
which time it was demaunded of him 
openly whose sonne he was ... he 
boldly answered, my hart geveth me, 
and my noble courage teileth me, that 
I am the sonne of the noble Duke of 
Orleaunce, more glad to be his Bastard 
with a meane lyving, then the lawfull 
sonne of that coward Cuckold Cawny, 
with his foure thousand crownes [a 
yere]. . . . Charles Duke of Orleaunce 
. . . tooke him into his family and gave 
him great offices and fees, which he 
well deserved, for (during his captivitie) 
he defended his landes, expulsed the 
Englishmen, and in conclusion procured 
his deliveraunce" (Grafton, i. pp. 576, 
577)-

48. appaled\appaVd Ff; appall' d, Steevens, Cambridge, Craig. 



47. thrice welcome] See Introduction 
on these compounds. 

48. appaled] Compare " pale of cheer " 
in Midsummer Night's Dream. Neiv 
Eng. Diet, distinguishes the two words 
appall and appale. Both occur in 
Golding's Ovid (ii. igo, viii. 671). 
Greene is fond of the word appale : 
" whose gorgeous presence so appaled 
my senses, y' I stood astonished " 
{Arbasto (Grosart, iii. 190), 1564, and 
often elsewhere). 

51. A holy maid hither with me I 
bring] Holinshed says (iii. 163), 1577: 
" In time of this siege at Orleance 
[March, 1428-9] . . . was caried a 
yoong wench of an eighteene yeeres old, 
called Jone Are, by name of hir father 
(a sorie sheepheard) lames of Are, and 
Isabell hir mother, brought up poorelie 
in theyr trade of keeping cattell. . . . 
Of favour was she counted likesome, 
of person stronglie made and manlie, 
of courage great, bardie and stout with- 
all: an understander of counsels though 
she were not at them ; great semblance 
of chastitie . . . the name of lesus in 
hir mouth about all hir businesses. . . . 
A person (as theyr bookes make hir) 
raised up by power divine, onelie for 
succour to the French estate ... at the 
Dolphins sending by her assignement, 
from Saint Katherins Church of Fier- 
bois in Touraine (where she never had 
beene and knew not) in a secret place 
there among old iron, appointed she hir 
sword [see lines gS-ioi] to be sought 
out and brought hir, (that with five 
floure delices was graven on both sides) 
wherewith she fought and did manie 
slaughters by hir owne hands. On war- 
far rode she in armour cap a pie & 
mustered as a man ; before her an 
ensigne all white, wherin was lesus 
Christ painted with a floure delice in 



his hand. Unto the Dolphin into his 
gallerie when first she was brought ; 
and he, shadowing himselfe behind, 
setting other gaie lords before him to 
trie her cuiming from all the companie, 
with a salutation (that indeed marz alle 
the matter) she prickt him out alone, 
who thereupon had her to the end of the 
gallerie, where she held him an houre 
in secret and private talke, that of his 
priuie chamber was thought verie long 
(see line 118), and therefore would have 
broken it off ; but he made them a signe 
to let her sale on . . . she set out unto 
him the singular feats (forsooth) given 
her to understand by reuclation divine, 
that in vertue of that sword shee should 
atchive: which were, how with honor 
and victorie she would raise the siege 
at Orleance, set him in state of the 
crowne of F"rance, and drive the English 
out of the countrie (lines 53, 54). . . . 
Heereupon hehartened at full, appointed 
hir a sufficient armie with absolute 
power." Grafton is more condensed 
here, and more scurrilous concerning 
Puzell : "a ramp of such boldnesse," 
etc. (p. 580). He does not call her " of 
Arc," but " lone the Puzell" from the 
first. 

54. forth] prep, out of; as in 2 Henry 
VI. III. ii. 89, and two or three later 
passages. Compare Peele, David and 
Bethsabe (473, b) ; "he forced Thamor 
shamefully, And hated her, and threw 
her forth his doors." In the two later 
folios the reading at 2 Henry VI. in. 
ii. 89 is " from." 

55) 56. The spirit of deep prophecy 
. . . Exceeding the nine sibyls] Sibyls 
here stands for the sibylline books which 
the Cumffian Sibyl offered for sale to 
Tarquin, who bought but three. The 
Greek sibyls were set down at various 
numbers (Varro enumerates ten), but

never at nine. Joan's spirit of prophecy 
exceeds that of the nine books. Lane- 
ham introduces " one of the ten sibyls " 
to read "a proper poesy in Englishe 
rhj'me " before Queen Elizabeth at 
Kenihvorth (1575, Burn's reprint, p. 8) 
on the gth of July at eight o'clock in 
the evening. 

57. What 's past and what 's to come] 
See Troilus and Cressida, iv. v, 166, 
Compare Greene's Jama the Fourth 
(Grosart, xiii. 2ig) : — 

" Dread King, thy vassal! is a man of 
Art, 
Who knowes by constellations of 

the stars. 
By oppositions, and by dire aspects, 
The things are past and those that 
are to come," 
Most of Reginald Scot's great devils 
(bk. XV. ch. ii.), in Discoverie of Witch- 
craft, "know truly of things present, 
past, and to come." Spenser allots the 
gifts to " three honourable sages . . . 
" The first of them could things to 
come foresee ; 
The next could of thinges present 

best advise; 
The third things past could keep in 
memoree " 
(11. ix. 48, 49). Peele is more matter-of- 
fact :— 
" The feeble eyes of our aspiring 
thoughts 



Behold things present, and record 

things past ; 
But things to come exceed our 

human reach, 
And are 7iot painted yet in angels' 

eyes " 
(David and Bethsahe, 484, a). Peele's 
is as much the more poetical, as he is 
the more sensible, on this occasion, than 
the other extracts. 

59. unfallible] Elsewhere in Shake- 
speare the word is infallible. Then as 
now the choice in this prefix seems to 
have been a matter of fancy. A few 
common words, such as unfrequent 
and unfortunate, illustrate this. Greene 
especially adheres to Un, as in Un- 
constant, Uncurable, Undirect, Un- 
evitable. Unexperienced, Unperfect, 
Unpossible, Unproper, Unsatiate, Un- 
sufferable, Untolerable, and Unviolable. 
The modern tendency is to use In, the 
negative prefix, to words of obviously 
Latin types. Nashe affects unfallible: 
" unfallible prescriptions " (Pierce Pcni- 
lessc, etc. (Grosart ii. 126), 1592) : " un- 
fallible rules " (Have with you, etc. 
(iii. 11) 1596), and unfallibly in many 
places, 

64. wondrous feats] Compare Kyd's 
Spanish Tragedy, 1. iii. 62: "Don 
Beltazar . . . To winne renowne did 
wondrous feats of armes."

To shine on my contemptible estate :

God's mother deigned to appear to me, 
And in a vision full of majesty 
VVill'd me to leave my base vocation 
And free my country from calamity :

A favourite with Greene : " Shal I loue 
so lightly ? shal Fancie give me the

and in Kifig John, in. i. 46. He has 
also sivarth, swarthy, and swarty, in 
the same sense. Golding uses the word 
of discolouring clotted blood; "all his 
bodye wext stark cold and dyed swart" 
(Ovid's Metamorphoses, xii. 463) ; and 
again " The blacke swart blood gusht 
out" (xii. 357, 1567). Compare Grafton, 
i. 307 : " The king was of stature talle, 
somewhat sivarte or blacke of colour, 
strong of body." 

85. infus'd on mc] shed, or diffused 
on me. Not in this sense again in 
Shakespeare. New Eng. Diet, has a 
1420 example from Palladius on Hus- 
bandry. 

91. Resolve on this] decide on this, 
make your mind up on this. "This" 
refers to the following clause. With- 
out " on," it is a common sense. " Do 
but look on his hand, and that shall 
resolve you" (]on?,or\, Every Man out 
of his Humour, v. 2).

95. buckle 7i'ifh] grapple, or close 
with. The earliest example in New 
Eng. Diet, is from Grafton's Continua- 
tion of Hardyng, 1543. Shakespeare 
does not use the expression again, 
except in this play, iv'. iv. 5 and 
V. iii. 28, and also in 3 Henry VI. i. 
iv. 50. It occurs in Greene's writings : 
"The King of Lidia hearing this . . . 
levied a mighty army, and hasted 
forward to buckle with Acestes " {Or- 
pharion (Grosart, xii. 53), 1588-91). And 
in The Second Part of Tritameron 
(Grosart, iii. 131), 1587 : " he marvelled 
how Scilla durst buckle with his 
[Mithridates] great fortune, especially 
knowing that she had not deceived 
him at any time." Greene uses it 
again, and I have no parallels, except- 
ing his, of the date of these plays. See 
too his Alphonsus, King of Arragon 
(Grosart, xiii. 393, line 1585): "souldiers 
which themselves Long and desire to 
buckle with the foe, do need no words 
to egge them to the same." " Buckle 
to fight," or "to the field," is the 
Faerie Queene form (i. vi. 41, i. viii. 7). 
For an exact parallel to this sense, see 
extract from Hall, 3 Henry VI. i. ii. 
49. 

99. five flower-de-luces'] See extract 
at line 50. Malone in accepting 
Steevens's correction (from " fine ") 



says the same mistake has happened 
in Midsummer Night's Dream and in 
other places : " I have not hesitated 
to reform the text, according to Mr. 
Steevens's suggestion. In the MSS. 
of the age, u and n are undistinguish- 
able." To-day's compositors are of 
the same opinion. For flower -de-Uicc, 
see I. i. 80, note, 

loi. old iron] The words in Holin- 
shed. Perhaps the sanctity of its luck 
redeems the commonplace : " it is good 
luck to find old iron, but 'tis naught to 
keep it, and the trade (fighting) is 
crafty" (Three Lords and Three Ladies 
of London, ante 1588, Hazlitt's Dods- 
ley, vi. 485). 

104. Amazon] See again 3 Henry VI. 
IV, i. io5 and i. iv. 114. Amazons 
were familiar figures. There was "A 
Maske of Amazones in all Armore 
compleat " shown " before Her Majestic 
the Sonday night after twelf daie " in 
'^57^-19 (Cunningham's Revels Ac- 
counts, Shaks. Society, 1842, pp. 125- 
126), Sidney mentions a heroine who 
" On the same side on her thigh she 
ware a sword, which as it witnessed 
her to be an Amazon, or one following 
that profession, so it seemed but a 
needless weapon, since her other forces 
were without withstanding" (Arcadia, 
bk. i. p. 97, ed. 1739),

Lodge's Euphues Golden Legacie (Haz-

"and with this they strained one 
anothers hand. Which Ganimede 
espying, thinking hee had had his 
mistresse long inough at shrift, sayd: 
What, a match or no ? " And Nashe's 
The Utifortxinate Traveller (Grosart, 
V. 127) : "To returne to Heraclide be- 
low, whom the ugliest of all bloud 
suckers Esdras of Granado had under 
shrift." 

121. keeps no mean] uses no modera- 
tion. Not a common expression ; but 
compare Whitney's Emblems (of the 
Seven Sages), 1586 (edited Green, p. 
130) : " Keep still the meane did Cleo- 
bulus teache." " To use a mean " is 
often found. New Eng. Diet, quotes 
iiom Aureles -and Isabella, 1556: "The 
king axade them . . . what meane one 
oughte to keape in suche a case." 

124. what devise you on] what do you 
decide on. Compare Ben Jonson, 
Bartholomew Fair, iv. i : — 

" Haggise. Let him alone, we have 
devis'd better upon 't. 



Purecraft. And shall he not into 
the stocks then ? 

Bristles. No, mistress." 
New Eng. Diet, has two earlier ex- 
amples of "devise upon" meaning to 
resolve or decide upon, which is cer- 
tainly applicable here. 

126. r^cr^aw^s] cowards. See 2 Henry

pare Nashe, Epistle Dedicatorie to Have

at the last gaspe of surrendering all his

occurs ("to the last gasp") earlier in 
Stuhhs'' Anatomic of Abuses, 1583. "At 
latter gasp " was commoner in poetry.

[act I. 



This night the siege assuredly I '11 raise : 130

Since I have entered into these wars. 

Glory is like a circle in the water, 

Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself 

Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought. 135 

131. halcyou^s days] halcyons days Ff i, 2 ; halcyon days Ff 3, 4. 



Earlier in Golding's Ovid, bk. xiii. line 
781:— 

" the fame 
Heereof too Agamemnons eares the 
squorge of Trojans came" (1567). 
The word occurs in the same manner 
several times elsewhere in Marlowe's 
Tamburlaine, part ii. See note at i. iv. 
42. See too Peele's Edward I. (Dyce, 
406, b) : " Farewell, proud queen . . . 
The scourge of England and to English 
dames! " 

131. Saint Martinis summer] summer 
in late autumn, " Indian summer," at 
the feast of St. Martin. Martlemas (Nov. 
11), the time for hanging powdered 
beef, was an important period. Nares 
has confused this festival with St. 
Martin's ware, products from one of 
the many St. Martin's Lanes. No con- 
nection between St. Martin and the 
Alc^•on has been advanced to illustrate 
this passage, except the fortuitous one 
of the weather, which may occur in 
a fitting manner. -But there was a St. 
Martin's bird. Cotgrave (quoted in 
New Eng. Diet.) says it (oiseau de S. 
Martin) was the hen-harme or ring- 
tail. A^ew Eng. Diet, has only one 
illustration of this, " 1897, F. S. Elis 
{Reynard, 38) : And straightway hove 
within his sight Saint Martin's bird." 
I confess I am bewildered. In Caxton's 
Reynard the Fox, 1481 (Arber, p. 19), 
there is the following passage : " Tybert 
made hj-m sone redy toward maleper- 
duys and he sawe fro ferre come fleyng 
one of seynt martyns byrdes, tho cryde 
he lowde and saide al hayl gentyl byrde 
tome thy wynges hetherward and flee 
on my right side the byrde flewh forth 
vpon a tree whiche stoode on the lift 
side of the catte tho was tybert woo 
ffor he thought hit was a shrewd token 
and a sygne of harme." Does Caxton 
refer to the hen-harrier ? I can find no 
confirmation. Swainson says it is now 
held a lucky bird in the Hebrides, and 
that the French name is due to its 
appearance at that date. But Caxton's 
" gentyl bird " is not suggestive of the 



harrier. At any rate his passage, which 
seems to have been overlooked, is 
worthy of notice. 

131. halcyon's days] " Now a seven- 
night before the Mid-winter day, and 
as much after, the sea is allaied and 
calme for the sitting and hatching of the 
birds Halciones, whereupon these daies 
took the name Alcionis " (Plinie's 
NafurallHistorie{tTans. Holland, 1601), 
bk. ii. chap, xlvii.). " I remembred the 
halcyons dayes" (G. ]oye, Exp. Dan., 
2a, 1545, Stanford Dictionary). The 
term is in Warner's Albions England, 
p. 154, 1589, and many early writers. 

132. entered into these wars] made 
them my business ; taken them up. 

133-135. circle in the water . . . dis- 
perse to nought] This was a favourite 
metaphor. Malone and Holt White give 
a few parallels, as from Sir John Davis' 
Nosce Teipsmn, 1599, Harington's Or- 
lando Fiirioso (viii. 63), Sylvester's Du 
Bartas, and Chapman's Epistle Dedica- 
torie to his translation of the Iliad. 
Later it is found in Beaumont and 
Fletcher's Rollo, ii. i, 1624, and several 
times in Pope's writings. There was 
usually a stone or a pebble cast in and 
the applications manifold. Nashe uses 
it: "The clearest spring a little tucht 
is creased with a thousand circles : as 
those momentarie circles for all the 
world, such are our dreames" {Terrors 
of the Night (Grosart, iii. 237), 1594). 
Chapman has it in Ovids Banquet of 
Sense, 1595 : — 

" And as a pebble cast into a spring, 

We see a sort of trembling circles 
rise. 

One forming other in their issuing, 

Till over all the fount they cir- 
culize ; 

So this perpetual-motion-making 
kiss," etc. 
Rolfe quotes here from Clarke : " The 
simile and poetical image in these lines 
are more like Shakespeare's manner 
than anything in the whole play : but 
it is worthy of observation that the 
passage included within the five lines 



sc. II.] KING HENRY THP: SIXTH

has a remarkable air of irrelevancy as 
if it were introduced by some other 
hand than the one that wrote the main 
portion of the scene." But Charles's 
reply develops this remarkably and yet 
more irrelevantly ; the whole conca- 
tenation of metaphors reminds one of 
several "other hands." 

136. the Eiis^lish circle ends] Com- 
pare Peele, David and Bethsabe, 480, 
a):- 

" Hereon depend Achitophels de- 
lights 
And in this life his circle must be 
closed." 
Marlowe has " The loathsome circle of 
my dated life " {Tambiirlaine, Part I. 
II. vi.). 

138. proud insulting] "proud insult- 
ing queen" and " proud insulting boy" 
occur in 2 Henry VI. 11. i. 168 and n. 
ii. 84. "Proud insulting Soliman " 
occurs in Soliman and Persedea, v. iii. 
59 (Boas). See note at " insulting tyr- 
anny," IV. vii. 19 below; a.nd at "proud 
commanding," iv. vii. 88. See "proud 
ambitious," Part III. v. v. 17. 

138, 139. proud insulting ship . . . 
Casar and his fortune] The ship was 
only proud because of her burthen. 
The anecdote is in Plutarch's Life of 
jfulius Ceesar (trans. North, 1579), 
Temple Classics, vii. 1712 : "he fol- 
lowed a dangerous determination, to 
embark unknowen in a little pinnace of 
twelve oars only to pass over the sea 
again, unto Brundusium . . . there 
came a great wind . . . the encounter 
was marvellous dangerous . . . the 
master of the pinnace . . . bade the 
mariners to cast about again . . . but 
Caesar then taking him by the hand said 
unto him. Good fellow, be of good cheer 
and forwards hardily, fearlnot, for thou 
hast CcEsar and his fortune with thee. 
. . . But at length . . . Csesar then to his 
great grief was driven to return back 
again." Greene has this tale in The 
Second Part of Tritameron (Grosart, iii. 



131), 1587, where the ship is a "little 
Frygat." Greene's words are from T. 
Bowes's translation of Primaudaye's 
French Academic (1577, trans. 1586). 
See also Peele's Farewell to the Gener- 
als, 1589 : " You bear, quoth he, Casar 
and Ca-sar's fortune in your ships." 

140. Mahomet inspired with a dove] 
Grey quotes Raleigh's History of the 
World, 1614, bk. i. part i. ch. vi., to 
this effect, the only illustration in 
Steevens's Shakespeare. But Nashe 
made use of the legend earlier, as in 
The Terrors of the Night (Grosart, iii. 
22S), 1594: "Socrates Genius was one 
of this stampe, and the Doue where- 
with the Turks hold Mahomet their 
Prophet to bee inspired." And see 
Nashe again in Lenten Stuffe (Grosart, 
v. 258), where the fable is given at 
length. There was a famous play of 
this date (or earlier) now lost, named 
The Turkish Mahomet and Hiren, the 
Fair Greek. In the Irving Shake- 
speare a reference is given to Reginald 
Scot's Discoveric of Witchcraft (1584), 
xii. 15, where Mahomet's pigeon is 
described. It is at p. 204 of reprint. 

141. with an eagle art inspired] The 
holy Joan is compared by Charles to 
the apostle John. In Christian art the 
eagle is the attribute of St. John the 
Evangelist, the symbol of the highest 
inspiration. "With" means "by" here. 

142. Helen, the mother of great Con- 
stantine] An early notice of Helen in 
Hakluyt (edition 1904, iv. 272) refers to 
her visions: "Being warned by some 
visions she went to Jerusalem and 
visited all the places there which Christ 
had frequented. She lived to the age 
of fourescore yeeres, and then died at 
Rome the 15 day of August . . . her 
sonne Constantine the Emperor then 
also living, and her body is to this day 
very carefully preserved at Venice." 
Joan claims a vision (line 79). 

143. Saint Philip's daughters] See 
Acts xxi. 9.

the fayre shining sterre ! O lady 
Venus ! I pray thee provide." 

145. reverently] with respect. See 
3 Henry VI. 11. ii. 109. 

148. immortalized] Not met with 
again in Shakespeare. The earliest 
example in this sense, "to cause to be 
commemorated or celebrated through 
all time," is from Greene's Menaphon, 
15S9 : " holde, take thy favors (and 
therewith he threw her her gioue) and 
immortalize whom thou wilt with thy 
toys ; for I will to Arcadie in despite of 
thee " (Grosart, vi. 110). For a note 
on verbs in -ize, see Lovers Labour's 
Lost, at " sympathised," Arden edition, 
pp. 46, 47. Harvey adopts it of him- 
self as the one " That must immortalise 
the killcowe Asse " [Nashe] (Pierce's 
Supererogation (Grosart, ii. 18), 1592). 
Spenser wrote " whose living handes 
immortaliz'd his name " (Faerie Queene, 
II. viii. 13), earlier than the above ex- 
amples. Spenser also has " eternize " 
in Faerie Queene, 1. x. 59; and "tyr- 
annize," II. X. 57, III. ii. 23. He 
has " equalize " later, in Ruines of 
Rome. 



Scene hi. 



2. conveyance] underhand dealing. 
A common word at this time. See 
3 Henry VL iii. iii. 160. Compare

" For he was school'd by kinde in

Of close conveyance, and each

4. Open the gates ; 'tis Gloucester

13. Break up the gates'\ batter them 
to pieces. Malone quotes from Hall's 
Chronicle, Henry VI. (folio 78, b) : 
" The lusty Kentishmen hopyng on 
more friends, brake up the gaytes of the 
King's Bench and Marshalsea," etc. 
Whalley refers to Micah ii. 13, and 
St. Matthew xxiv. 43. Compare for 
the milder sense " to open,'" 2 Henry VI. 
I. iv. 22 ; Winter s Tale, iii. ii. 132 ; 
Love's Labour's Lost, iv. i. 56, etc. 
See also Holinshed's account of 1381 
rebellion. 

13. warrantize] surety, pledge, gua- 
rantee. See Sonnet cl. Compare 
Greene, Orlanilo Furioso (Grosart, xiii. 

155) ■— 

" Thou bringest store of men from 
Mexico 
To battaile him that scornes to 

iniure thee. 
Pawning his colours for thy war- 
rantize." 



Nashe and Harvey both use the word 
later, and make a verb of it. 

14. Jlouted] mocked, made a fool of. 
A favourite word with Shakespeare, 
but not an early term. Compare Greene, 
Farewell to Folly (Grosart, ix. 232) : 
" Others v/\]\JloHt and over reade euerie 
line with a frumpe, and say tis scuruie " ; 
and in his Alphnnsus : "doth black 
Pluto . . . seeke for iofioiit me with 
his counterfeit." See below at iv. i. 
75 for example from Grafton. Peele 
has " I flout you not " in Sir Clyomon 
(516 a, Routledge ed.), earlier. 

14. dunghill grooms'^ Compare 
'^dunghill curs," 2 Henry IV. v. iii. 
108. Greene has the expression earlier : 
" What, thinkst thou, vilain, that high 
Amurath . . . yeeld his daughter . . . 
Into the hands of such a dunghill 
Knight" {Alphonsns, King of Arra- 
gon, Grosart, xiii. 404). And (Peek's) 
Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 
406) :— 

" How darest thou a dunghill bastard 
born. 
To brave thy sovereign and his 
nobles thus ? " 
Spenser has " doonghill kind" (Faerie 
Quecne, 11. xii. 87); ^' dounghill m'md" 
(Faerie Queene, iii. x. 15) ; " dunghill 
thoughts" (Teares 0/ the Muses). See 
note in Todd's Spenser, Faerie Queene, 
VI. vii. I. An older expression, " dung- 
hil thoughts," occurs in Gascoigne 
(Whetstone's Rcmetnbraunce, Arber, p. 
18, 1576).

THE FIRST TART OF 



[act 



W'oocL Have patience, noble Duke ; I may not open ; 
The Cardinal of Winchester forbids: 

From him I have express commandment 20 

That thou nor none of thine shall be let in. 

Glou. Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me ? 
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate, 
Whom tienry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook ? 
Thou art no friend to God or to the king: 25 

Open the gates, or I '11 shut thee out shortly. 

Fif'st Sen'. Open the gates unto the lord protector. 

Or we '11 burst them open, if that j^ou come not quickly. 

Enter to the Protector at the Toiver Gates, WINCHESTER and 
his men ifi tawny coats. 

Win. How now, ambitious Humphrey! what means this? 
Glou. Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out ? 30

22. Faint-hearted] See 3 Henry VI. 
I. i. 183. Occurs again only in Titus 
Andronicus, in. i. 65. Compare Faerie 
Queene, 1. ix. 52 : — 

" Fie, he, faint hearted knight ! 
What meanest thou by this re- 
prochfull strife ? " 

23. haughty] See note at "come, 
come," III. iii. 76, 

23, 24. Arrogant Winchester . . , 
Whom Henry . . . ne'er could brook] 
Boswetl Stone's Shakcspere's Holinshcd 
(and Hall) does not give the source of 
this, or the " Cardinal " references (lines 
19-49). I find it in Grafton, i. 571, 572 
(The V. Yere) : " The Duke of Bedford 
, . , landed at Calice, with whome also 
passed the seas, Henry Bishop of 
Winchester, which in the sayde towne 
was invested with the Habite, Hat, and 
dignitie of a Cardinall, with all Cere- 
monies to it apperteynyng. Which 
degree King Henrie the fift, knowyng 
the haute courage, and the ambicious 
minde of the man, prohibited him on 
his allegeance once [altogether], either 
to sue for or to take : meanyng y* [that] 
Cardinals Hats should not presume to 
be egal with princes. But now the 
king beyng yong, and the Regent his 
friend, he obteyned that dignitie . . . 
so was he surnamed the rich Cardinall 
of Winchester, and neyther called 
learned Bishop, nor virtuous Priest." 
See V. i. 32, 33 for a further reference 
to Henry V. and the Cardinal. 



28. tawny coats] A tawny coat was 
the garb of an apparitor or sumner, an 
official attendant on a bishop. In Har- 
ington's Brief View of the Stale of the 
Church, 1608 (Nuga Antiqucr, i. 8), 
occurs this passage: " Docter White- 
gyte was made Bishop of Worcester 
. . . though the revenew of that be 
not very great, yet his custom was to 
come to the Parliament very well 
attended, which was a fashion the Queen 
liked exceeding well. It happened one 
day Bishop Elmer of London, meeting 
this Bishop with such an orderly troop 
of Tawny Coats, and demanding of him 
how he could keep so many men, he 
answered it was by reason he kept so 
few women." In Day's Blind Beggar 
of Bednal Green the Cardinal, who is 
disguised as his own servant, is called 
Tom Tawny Coat. In Jonson's Love's 
Welcome at Welbeck, " Tawny, the 
Abbot's churl," is mentioned, though 
it may refer to his hood. Musicians, 
pedlars, and justices' clerks also wore 
tawny coats. See also Hey wood's 
A Maidenhead well Lost (Pearson, p. 
114), and Middleton's A Roaring Girl: 
"Enter Greenwit like a Sumner. . . . 
Husband, lay hold on yonder tawny 
coat " (iv. ii.). 

30. Pecl'd]tonsurcd, shaven. Jonson 
has the verb referring to hair: "Who 
scorns at eld, peels off his own young 
hairs" (Sad Shepherd, 11. ii.).

I '11 canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat, 
If thou proceed in this thy insolence. 

Win. Nay, stand thou back ; I will not budge a foot : 
This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain, 

34. dead'\ Ff I, 3, 4 ; dread F 2. 



35 



31. /rorfzVor] traitor. Not elsewhere 
in Shakespeare. Nashe has the deriva- 
tive, " proditoriously," in Lenten Stuff e 
(Grosart, v. 284). 

34. contriv'dst] plotted. 

34. contriv''dst to murder our dead 
lord] The 4th Item of Gloucester's 
Accusations laid to Winchester's charge 
is: "that our Soueraigne Lorde his 
brother, that was King Henry the fift, 
tolde him on a time when our sayde 
soueraigne Lorde beyng Prince, was 
lodged in the Palaice of Westminster 
in the great Chamber, by the noyes of 
a spanyell there was on a night a man 
spied and taken behinde a tapet of the 
sayd chamber, the which man was de- 
livered to the Erie of Arundell . . . 
confessed that he was there by the stir- 
ring vp and procuring of my sayde Lorde 
of Winchester ordeyned to have slaine 
the sayd prince there in his bed : 
Wherefore the sayde Erie of Arundell 
let sacke him forthwith and drowned 
him in the Thames" (Grafton, i. 563, 
The IIIJ Yere). 

35. giv'st whores indulgences to sin] 
The title of an Act passed, 1162, ran: 
" Ordinances touching the government 
of the stewholders in Southwark under 
the direction of the Bishop of Win- 
chester." The Row was on the Clink, 
Bankside, white, with signs, as Bear's 
Head, Crane, Cardinal's Hat, Swan, 
Bell, Castle, Cross Keys, Gun, Thatched 
House. There were 18 in Henry VU.'s 
time, reduced to 12 in 1506, abolished 
1545, but only in name. Latimer, in 
1549 (Seven Sermons, Arber, p. 81), 
refers to them : " I here say, ther is 
now more whordom in London, than 
ever ther was on the bancke." See 
Stowe's Survey of London. See note 
at in. ii. 7, Measure for Measure (Arden 
ed.). Dekker gives the constitutions 
to be observed at the Bordello (as these 
stews were called) in The Dead Tearme, 



1608 (Grosart, iv. 56, 57). " Indul- 
gences " bear the papist sense, absolu- 
tion from punishment. This is ex- 
plained by a note at "pernicious 
usurer," iii. i. 17. 

36. canvass thee . . . cardinal's hat] 
toss in a canvas sheet, blanket, belabour. 
An old form of punishment, or rough 
amusement, often applied to a dog. 
The use was influenced by the other 
meaning, to search out or examine 
thoroughly, as in a canvas sieve. Com- 
pare Palsgrave, Lesclaircissement, 
1530 : " I kanvas a doggc or a matter, 
Jetraffique." And Nashe: "they wrapt 
him in a blanket (like a dog to be ciui- 
vasde) . . . and so threwe him under- 
boord " [Martins Months Mind (Grosart, 
i. 194), 1589). In the general sense of 
abused Greene has it often : " too sore 
canvased in the Nettes, to strike at 
euery stale" (Mamillia, Grosart, ii. 17, 
and again, p. 169). Nashe gives a good 
parallel : " Hence Greene . . . tooke 
occasion to canvaze him [Harvey] 
a little in his Cloth-breeches and Velvet- 
breeches " (Foure Letters Confuted 
(Grosart, ii. 197)1592). " The Cardinal's 
Hat" was one of the Bankside signs 
mentioned at line 35 (note). See note at 
" Arrogant Winchester," line 23, above. 

38. / will not budge a foot] Greene 
has this expression : — 

" Backe to thy ships, and hie thee to 
thy home ; 
Bouge not a foote to aid Prince 
Rodomant" 
{Orlando Furioso, Grosart, xiii. 155). 
" I'll not budge an inch " is in Taming 
of the Shrew, Induction, i. 14. 

39. Damascus . . . cursed Caiji] 
Reed quotes Maundeville's Travels, 
ed. 1725, p. 148: "And in that place 
where Damascus was founded, Kaym 
sloughe Abell his brother." Ritson 
cites Polychronicon, folio xii. : " Da- 
mascus is as moche to say as shedynge

GloH. I will not slay thee, but I '11 drive thee back : 

Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth 

I '11 use to carry thee out of this place. 
Win. Do what thou dar'st ; I beard thee to thy face. 
Glou. What ! am I dar'd and bearded to my face ? 45 

Draw, men, for all this privileged place ; 

Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard ; 

I mean to tuj^ it, and to cuff you soundl}\ 

Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat. 

In spite of pope or dignities of church ; 50

Win. Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope. 
Glou. Winchester goose ! I cry, a rope ! a rope ! 

Now beat them hence ; why do you let them stay ?

of blood. For there Chayme slowe 
Abell, and hydde hym in the sonde." 
F"or Abel again, see Richard II. i. i. 104. 

42. child's bearing-cloth] christening 
robe. See again Winter's Tale, iii. iii. 
119. And in Holland's Plitiie, bk. 
xxviii. ch. 19 (p. 341 C) : "To come 
now to little infants ... If a child be 
lapped in a mantle or bearing-cloth 
made of an asse skin, it shall not be 
affrighted at any thing." Gloucester is 
still thinking perhaps of the canvassing 
process. 

44. beard thee] defy thee, face thee. 
See again 2 Henry VI. iv. x. 40, and 
J Henry IV. iv. i. 12. 

47. Blue coats] the ordinary wear of 
serving men. 

50. dignities of church] dignitaries 
of church. Shakespeare's plays do not 
afford another example of this use. 
New Eng. Diet, has earlier references. 

53. Winchester goose] See again 
Troiltis and Cressida, v. x. 55. A cant 
name for a venereal disorder, with a 
reference to line 35. See Nares; and 
Cotgrave in several places (1611). In 
Guilpin's Skialetheia, 1598 (rept., p. 
27) it is varied to " Hampshire goose." 
Often in Chapman's and Webster's 



plays, as in Westward Ho, iii. 3 : " The 
term lying at Winchester . . . every 
one that met him cried Ware the goose, 
collier." See too Beaumont and Flet- 
cher's Cure for a Cuckold, and Jonson's 
Underwoods, Ixii. 

53. a rope! a ro/^/] a halter! a halter! 
Similar to the scurrilous abuse contained 
in the expressions "ropery," "rope- 
tricks" and "rope-ripe," all in use at 
this period. And compare " like the 
parrot, beware the rope's end," in 
Comedy of Errors, iv. iv. 46, "A rope, 
a rope," was a parrot-cry of abuse ; 
" an almond for parrot " was the reward 
for some parrot-like tricks. The two are 
met together in Lyly's Mydas, i. ii. ; 
and in Lyly's Mother Bombie, in. iv. : — 
" The duck cries quack : 
A rope the parrot, that holds tack." 

55. wolf in sheep's array] See St. 
Matthew vii. 15 : " ther is a wolfe in a 
lombe skynne " {Digby Mysteries, circa, 
1485, ed. F'urnivall, p. 155). 

56. scarlet hypocrite] Alludes to the 
cardinal's red soutane, with a recollec- 
tion of Isaiah i. 18. Compare Henry 
VIII. III. ii. 255. 

56. /no-Zj-ir/r/j] tumult, uproar. For- 
merly a more dignified word than now.

81. break our minds] reveal what 's in 
our minds. Compare Henry V. v. ii. 
265. Golding uses the expression in 
Ovid's Metamorphoses, x. 458-60; — 
" But nerethelesse shee gest 
There was some love : and stand- 
ing in one purpose, made request 
Too breake her mynd untoo her " 
(1567). New Eng. Diet, has an ex- 
ample from Berner's Froissart, 1525. 
" Break the matter " in Grafton's Con- 
tinuation of Hardyng (502), 1543, is 
similar. 

83. heart-blood] peculiar to these 
three plays and Richard II. in Shake- 
speare. "Vital energy, life" {New 
Eng. Diet.). An old expression. Figu- 
ratively used in Troilus and Cressida. 
See note, Part III. i. i. 223. 

84. call/or clubs] See Nares at the 
word "clubs". Originally the call to 
summon the 'prentices to part, or take 
part in a street riot. New Eng. Diet. 
quotes Hall's Chronicle, Henry VIII. 
9: "All the young men . . . cryed 
prentyses and clubbes. Then out at 
euerie doore came clubbes and weapons, 
and the aldermen fled " (1548). Com- 
pare Three Lords and Three Ladies of 
London (Hazlitt's Dodsley, vi. 459), 
1587,1588: "Simplicity. Clubs! clubs! 
Nay, come, neighbours, come, for here 
they be : here I left them, arrant thieves, 
rogues, coseners. I charge ye, as you 
will answer, 'prehend them. . . . A 



Constable. I charge ye keep the peace 
and lay down your weapons." Malone 
says it was " for peace ofticers armed 
with clubs or staves." It came to be 
equivalent to our " police ! " Compare 
Greene, A Hee and Shee Conycatcher 
(Grosart, x. 215): "the Officer . . . 
sayd hee was his true prisoner, and 
cride clubbes : the Prentises arose and 
. . . tooke the Officers part." 

89. See the coast clear'd] see that 
all obstructions or impediments are re- 
moved. A common expression occur- 
ing in the play referred to at line 84, 
note (Hazlitt's Dodsley, vi. 496) : " The 
coast is clear. Come, follow. Fraud, 
and fear not." And Greene: "Susanna 
. . . thinking there secretly to washe 
hirselfe, and seeing the coast clcere, 
and hirselfe solitarily said thus " (A 
Myrror of Modestie (Grosart, iii. 18), 
1584). Not met with again in Shake- 
speare. 

90. stomachs] angry tempers, bitter 
resentment. See again iv. i. 141 ; and 
Part H. II. i. 55. Compare Golding's 
Ovid's Metamorphoses, bk. v. 308-10: — 

" Nor yet the perils he endurde, nor 
all this troublous toyles 
Could cause thy stomacke to relent. 
Within thy stonie breast 
Workes such a kinde of festred 
hate as cannot be represt" 
(1567). Greene has the expression in 
George-a-Greene (xiv. 168) : " My friend,

press " many." Common in Shake- 
speare. 

Scene iv. 

2. how the English have the suburbs 
won] See note at i. ii. 21 from Grafton. 
The Chronicle continues to the present 
scene. " In the Tower that was taken 
at the bridge ende, as you before have 
heard, there was a high Chamber, hau- 
yng a Grate full of barres of yron by the 
which a man might loke all the length 
of the bridge into the City, at which 
grate many of the chiefe Capteynes 
stoode dyverse times viewyng the Citie, 
and deuisyng in what place it was best 
assautable. They within the Citie 
perceyued well this totyng hole, and 
layde a piece of ordinaunce directly 
agaynst the Windowe. It so chaunced 
that the lix. day after the siege layd 
before the Citie, the Erie of Sarisbury, 
Sir Thomas Gargraue, and William 
Glasdale, and diuerse other, went into 
the sayde Tower, and so into the high 
Chamber and looked out at the Grate, 
and within a short space the sonne of 
the Maister Goonner, perceyvyng men 
look out at the Chamber windowe, took 
his matche, as his father had taught 
him, which was gone downe to dinner, 
and fired the Goon, which brake and 
sheuered the yron barres of the grate, 
whereof one strake the Erie so strongly 



on the hed, that it stroke away one of 
his eyes and the side of his cheeke, Sir 
Thomas Gargraue was likewise stricken, 
so that he died within two dayes. The 
Erie was conveyed to Meum upon 
Loyre, where he lay beyng wounded, 
viij dayes, and then died, whose bodie 
was conveyed into England, with all 
funerall pompe, and buried at Bissam 
by his progenitors " (p. 577). This 
occurred in October. 1428. 

8. espials] spies. Occurs again below, 
IV. iii. 6, and in Hamlet, iii. i. 32. 
Usually plural. " Espial" is a body of 
spies in the concrete ; hence a spy. 
Greene uses it several times. "The 
Cittie of Athens was destroyed by Silla 
the Romaine Dictator, who by his 
espyals was admonished by the prattling 
of certaine women washing of their 
cloathes, where they talked of a certaine 
place in the Towne that was weake 
and worst defended " {Penelopes Web 
(Grosart, v. 222, 223), 1587). And again : 
" Hector having by his espials under- 
standing of their comming " (vi. 234 ; 
Euphues his Censure to Philautus,i^^j). 
The word is commonly used by the 
Chroniclers. 

10. Went] The change to " Wont " is 
desirable, but not imperative. " Went,'' 
in the sense of went several times, were 
used to go (to overpeer the city and 
discover, etc.), is very intelligible, and 
the word had the widest general usage. 
The alteration was suggested by Tyr- 
whitt. ''Wont'' has already occurred 
(I. ii. 14).

II. overpeer] Occurs again in 3 Henry 
VI. V. ii. 14, and in Hamlet, iv. v. gg, 
and Merchant of Venice, i. i. 12, but 
the senses are not the same as here, 
i.e., to look over, down on, or across 
from above. It is a favourite with 
Greene, and the first example in New 
Eng. Diet, is from his Menaphon, i58g : 
" a hill tha.t over-peered the great Medi- 
teraneum." See again Orlando Furioso 
(Grosart, xiii. 182) : " On a hill that 
overpeeres them both"; and p. 121 : 
"the Clifts That overpiere the bright and 
golden shore." And in The Spanish 
Masquerado (i58g) : " their huge barkes 
built like Castles, overpeering ours." 
Compare Golding's Ovid (iii. 217) : " by 
the middle of hir necke she ovcrpeerde 
them all " (1565) ; and Peele's Arraign- 
ment of Paris (Dyce, 352, b) : "The 
double daisy and the cowslip, queen Of 
summer flowers, Ao overpeer the green " 
(meaning "overtop"). Perhaps Golding 
introduced it. 

16-18. And even . . . longer] A cor- 



rupt passage, scarcely improved by the 
unimportant alterations in the later 
folios which were accepted by Steevens, 
who made it his business to attach 
more importance to the readings of the 
second folio than Malone did — or than 
they are entitled to. 

23. Talbot] Talbot, who was not 
present historically at this disaster, 
appears immediately in the Chronicle : 
" The Duke of Bedford . . .seeyngthat 
dead men cannot with sorowe be 
called aj^aine . . . appoynted the Erie 
of Suffolke to be his Lieutenant and 
Capteyne of the Siege, and ioyned with 
him the Lord Scales, the Lord Talbot, 
Sir lohn P'astolfe, and diuerse other 
valiant knightes and squiers " (p. 578, 
The VI. Yere). Historical inaccuracy in 
this drama is very prominent. The 
events are often transposed, backward 
or forward, out of their proper years, 
especially those at home, with regard 
to those at the seat ot war. For a note 
on Talbot's repute, see i. i. 121.

28-29. Lord Ponton . . , exchang'd] 
The ransom of Lord Talbot, historically, 
took place several years later after a 
defeat by the English at Beauvais in 
1431. There was an ambush "of 
xxiij hundreth men . . . priuely in a close 
place, not farre from the sayd towne. . . . 
The Frenchmen . . . issued out and man- 
fully fought with the Englishmen : 
which sodainly fled toward the stale. 
The Frenchmen corragiously followed, 
thinkyng the game gotten on their 
syde . . . there were slain and taken, 
in maner all the frenchmen. . . . 
Amongest the Captaynes was founde 
prisoner, the valiaunt Captaine, called 
Poynton of Sanctrayles, which (with- 
out delay) was exchaunged for the 
Lord Talbot, before taken prisoner at 
the battaile of Patay" (Grafton, pp. 
592-3, The X. Yere). 

30. man of arms] soldier. Some- 
times, as in Love's Labour's Lost, iv. 
iii. 2go, "man at arms." Compare 
Greene's Alphonsus (line 1670) : — 

" All the men at armcs 
Which mounted were on lustie 
coursers backes " ; 
and line 1808 : — 

"Your mightie countrie and your 
men at amies. 
Be conquered all." 
It occurs as "man of aryns" in Graf- 
ton's Chronicle, 1569. 

31. barter'd] Not again in Shake- 
speare. 



35. Fastolfe] Theobald ; Falstaffe 

33. vile-esteem'd] Pope's correction 
is proved by the first line of Sonnet 
cxxi. Steevens says he " cannot help 
smiling at his own conjecture." 

35. treacherous Fastolfe] See note 
at I. i. 131. ' 

36. bare fsts] bare hands. Craig 
quotes from Greene's Orlando Furioso 
(Grosart, xiii. 161) : " We will not leaue 
one of our owne souldiers aliue, for we 
two will kill them with our fists." Com- 
pare Golding's Ovid, xiii. 10, 11 : " It 
easyer is therefore with woordes in 
print too maynteine stryfe, then for 
to fyght it out with fists " (the Battle 
of Troy being the scene). 

39. contumelious] See above, sc. iii. 58. 

42. the terror of the French] Graf- 
ton writes at the death of Talbot 
(pp. 650, 651, The XXXII. Yere) : 
•' This man was to the French people 
a very scourge and a daylie terror, in 
so much that as his person was fearefuU 
and terrible to his adversaries present : 
so his name and fame wasspitefull and 
dreadfuU to the common people absent, 
in so much that women in Fraunce 
to feare their yong children, would 
crie, the Talbot commeth, the Talbot 
commeth." See above, i. ii. 129, and 
note ; and below, 11. iii. 16. The same 
was said of King Richard in the Holy 
Land; and of Drake by the Spaniards. 
" It was also stated about William 
Wallace as well as the Black Douglas 
and the English mothers" (Craig).

The scarecrow that affrights our children so. 

Then broke I from the officers that led me, 

And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground, 45 

To hurl at the beholders of my shame. 

My grisly countenance made others fly ; 

None durst come near for fear of sudden death. 

In iron walls they deem'd me not secure ; 

So great fear of my name 'mongst them were spread 50 

That they supposed I could rend bars of steel 

And spurn in pieces posts of adamant : 

Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had, 

That walk'd about me every minute-while ; 

And if I did but stir out of my bed 55 

Ready they were to shoot me to the heart. 

Enter the Boy with a linstock. 
Sal. I grieve to hear what torments you endured ;

Steevens quotes to the same purport 
of Warwick, from Drayton's Miseries 
of Queen Margaret : — 

"And still so fearful was great 
Warwick's name, 
That being once cry'd on, put 
them oft to flight." 
Steevens also points out that " Dryden 
has transplanted this idea into his Don 
Sebastian." See note, ii. i. 79. The 
legend about Talbot, " the valiant cap- 
tain, the very scourge of France," is 
found also in E. K.'s notes to Spenser's 
Shcpheards Calendar (June), 1579. 

43. scarecrow] Again in Measure for 
Measure and 1 Henry IV. Spenser 
calls his Braggadocchio {Faerie Queene, 
III. iii. 7) the scarecrow. 

45. nails . . . stones] Com^zxe Rich- 
ard II. V. V. 18, 19. Marlowe has the 
same figure : — 

" Set me to scale the high Pyramides, 
And thereon set the diadem of 

France : 
I '11 either rend it with my nails 

to naught 
Or mount the top " 
{Massacre at Paris, Dyce, 1859, p. 228, 
b). And Peele, Edward I. (Dyce, p. 
378, a) :- 

" Lords, these are they will enter 
brazen gates 
And tear down lime and mortar 
with their nails." 
See " bare fists " above, line 36. 
47. grisly] grim, full of terror. 



53. chosen shot] picked gunners. 
Compare Peele, Battle of Alcazar, iv. 

i-57:— 

" Hamet, my brother, with a 
thousand shot 
On horseback, and choice harque- 

buziers all, 
Having ten thousand [foot] with 

spear and shield. 

Shall make the right wing of the 

battle up." 

As a single marksman, see 2 Henry IV. 

III. ii. 295. See passage from Spanish 

Tragedy quotedat "squadrons, "iv.ii. 23. 

54. minute-while] minute's space. 
Shakespeare has "breathing-while," and 
other compounds elsewhere. 

56. litistock] Compare Henry V. ni. 
(chorus, 33). A staff with a cleft end 
to hold a light, or prepared lint for 
torch. The staff was of any length 
to suit the requirements. In Chapman's 
All Fools the term is used of a torch 
for a tobacconist's use. In Voyage of 
the Susan, etc., 1582-3 (Hakluyt. v. 248, 
reprint 1904): "a gunner standing by 
with a lint-stocke in his hand about four- 
teen or fifteen feet long, being (as we 
thought) ready to give fire." Ben 
Jonson has the word: "they had 
planted me three demi-culverins just in 
the mouth of the breach ; now, sir, as 
we were to give on, their master gunner 
. . . confronts me with his linstock, 
ready to give fire" {Every Man in his 
Humour, in. {., 1598).

One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace : 

The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.

67. bulwark] fortification. A bul- Bookes Messenger (Grosart, xi. 6),

pattern, exemplar. Compare "mirror Tamburlainc, Part I. iv. i. 30.

gi. whiles] while, whilst. It has 
the sense of until here, a common use. 
See Greene's Looking Glass for London 
and England (Grosart, xiv. 45) ; Ben 
Jonson's The Devil is an Ass, i. ii. (Cun- 
ningham's Gifford, vol. ii. 218, b) ; Mas- 
singers Roman Actor, v. i (with notes 
by Gifford). And King James, Demoiio- 
logie: "When the conjured spirit ap- 
pears, which will not be while after 
many circumstances." Still in use in 
provincial Ireland, " wait while I come," 
etc. Greene's Pandosto and Lodge's 
Euphues Golden Legacie give examples, 
as Schmidt points out. Talbot had 
more to tell him when he breaks off. 

93. As who should say] as if he should 
say, like one that would say. It occurs 
several times in Shakespeare, as in 
Merchant of Venice, i. ii. 51. See 
Schmidt, 1040, b. And Nashe, Pierce 
Penilcsse (Grosart, ii. 28) : " Some 
think to be counted rare Politicians and 
Statesmen, by being solitary, as who 
should say, I am a wise man, a brave 
man, Secreta mea mihi," etc. And see 
Gascoigne, Philomene (Arber, p. 90), 
1575 ; Marlowe, Jew of Malta, Act iv. ; 
and Golding's Ovid, bk. xv. line 98 
(Moring, p. 297). In the last example 
the meaning is doubtful. 



93. dead and gone] See 2 Henry VI. 
II. iii. 37, and Ophelia's song in //aw/^<, 
IV. V. 29. See Gratton, Cant, of Hard- 
yng (436), 1543 : " their capitaines were 
dedde and gone.'" New Eng. Diet, gives 
early examples of this expression (al- 
ways taken literally). It has a sort of 
ballad-tag ring about it. Skelton uses 
it in Garlande of Laurell. Several 
times in Greene's plays. 

95. Nero] Grafton {Chronicle, i. 61) 
gives a page to this much-abused mon- 
arch, describing the above episode: 
" He commaunded the City of Rome to 
be set on fyre, and himself in the meane 
season, with all semblant of joy, sitting 
in an high Tower to beholds the same, 
played upon the Harpe, and sang the 
destruction of Troy." " The situations, 
look you, is both alike . . . and there 
is towers in both." Nero is referred to 
again in 3 Henry VL III. i. 40 ; and 
in King Lear, Hamlet and King 
John. 

100. gather'd head] gathered an 
army. See below, iv. v. 10, part ii., 
and Titus Andronicus, iv. iv. 63, Com- 
pare Peele, Battle of Alcazar, iii. i : — 
" The Spaniard ready to embark him- 
selfe, 
Here gathers to a head"

4. a hout^ about F 2. 



4. / 7/ have a bout with thee] See 
below, HI. ii. 56 ; and in Twelfth Night, 
III. iv. 337 ; and Romeo and Juliet, 1. 
V. 19. No example previous to Shake- 
speare is given in New Eng. Diet. ; so 
that, like the last, it is characteristic, 
perhaps. But it is frequent in Nashe, 
and earlier, as : " Euery mans spirit 
. . . had two bouts witJi the Apostle 
before hee left him " {Pasquils Returne 
(Grosart, i. 119), 1589); and later in 
Pierce Penilesse (ii. 59) : " With the 
enemies of Poetry, I care not if/ have 
a bout " ; and in Strange News (ii. 179), 
1593. Greene has it also earlier, in 
Tullies Love (Grosart, vii. 202), 1589: 
" in his owne minde having a bouie 
or two with fancie." The latter has it 
again in The Defence of Conny-Calching 
(xi. 79). Ben Jonson makes it technical 
of cudgel-play in The Case is Altered 
(1598). See too Locrine, n. ii. : " / will 
have a bout with you. [They fight.] " 

5. devil's dam] Quite curiously com- 
mon in Shakespeare. See Othello, iv. 
i. 150, and note (Arden edition). Greene 
has the expression once (at least) : " I 
wondred at it, and thought verily that 
the Devill and his Dam was in his 
fingers' (Second Part of Conny-Caich- 
ing. Grosart, x. 129). It is as old as 
Piers the Plowman (1399). 

6. Blood will I draw on thee] John- 
son's statement, "the superstition of 
those times taught that he that could 
draw the witch's blood was free from 
her power, " has not been illustrated, 
though constantly quoted. I have 



looked through all the likely Elizabethan 
writers that occurred to me (Reginald 
Scot, Ben Jonson, Middleton, etc.), 
but failed to detect a reference. Hender- 
son's Folklore of the Northern Counties 
(Folk-Lore Society, 1879) has the fol- 
lowing at p. 181 : " To draw blood 
above the mouth from the person who 
has caused any witchery is the ac- 
credited mode of breaking the spell." 
Several tales are told in support of this, 
from Durham, Devonshire and Exeter 
of the years 1868-70. On the following 
page a note states : " In Brittany, if 
the lycanthropist be scratched above the 
nose, so that three blood-drops are ex- 
tracted, the charm is broken. In Ger- 
many, the werewolf has to be stabbed 
. . . thrice on the brows." But noth- 
ing is cited of early times. Nor do 
Pliny or Ovid come to the rescue. 
Possibly there is no such reference at 
all, and Talbot merely means he will 
prove that Joan is vulnerable, and send 
her soul to hell. " To draw blood," 
meaning to spill blood, is frequent in 
Shakespeare; followed by "on" it 
occurs in King Lear, 11. i. 35. 

12. high-minded] "arrogant, over- 
weening" (Schmidt). Not met with 
again in Shakespeare. The term is not 
credited with any disparaging sense in 
New Eng. Diet., nothing worse than 
haughty. Greene uses it so in Friar 
Bacon. But compare Golding's Ovid's 
Metamorphoses (bk. xiii. line 916), 
where Polyphemus rejects the warning 
of Telemus : " And sayd foolish

Compare Greene, Menaphon (Grosart,

" The Turtle pearketh not on barren 
trees, Doves delight not in foule cot- 
tages." And Gabriel Harvey, Letters 
between Spenser and Harvey (Grosart, 
i. 89), 1573-80: " Fyle [defile] me the 
Doouehouse : leave it unhansome, 
where the like poorehouse ? " 

28. lions out of England's coat] 
Greene is fond of this kind of lan- 
guage : — 

" O English King, thou bearest in 
thy crest 
The King of Beasts, that harmes 

not yeelding ones . . . 
Be gracious " 



soothsayre thou deceyued art in that. 
. . . Thus skorning him that told him 
truthe because he was hyghmynded," 
i.e. bursting with conceit. Tlie term 
is in Grafton's Continuation of Hardyng 
(1543), p. 522, in the same sense (More, 

1513)- 

16. hungry-starved] hunger-starved, 
for which see 3 Henry VI. i. iv. 5. 
To starve is hardly now used (except 
provincially) apart from hunger (so that 
the compound seems tautological), but 
it had the general sense of to perish, 
or suffer want, from any cause in 
Shakespeare's time. To hunger-starve 
was in regular use at an early date and 
down to the sixteenth century. Nashe 
has a double adjective of similar for- 
mation : " He . . . hath compelled a 
tender-starv'd Mother to kille and eate 
her onely sonne " (Christes Teares, 
Grosart, iv. no). The alteration of 
the text here, introduced by Rowe, may 
be tempting, but it is absolutely im- 
proper. Huhger-starved is in Golding's 
Ovid. 

18. as many more shall be] Greene 
has this construction : — 

" Mocke on apace ! my backe is 

broad enough 
To beare your flouts, as many as 

they be "

structure with Marlowe. See Tainbttr- 
laine (Part II.): " Discomfited is all the 
Aristian host" (ii. iii. i). But he de- 
sists from it in later plays, after the 
well-known "Cut is the branch" at 
the close of Doctor Faustus. See the 
first line of this play ; also " .\ssign'd 
am I . . ." (i. ii. 129). And Greene- 
Lodge, A Looking Glass, etc. (Grosart, 
xiv. 83) : " Loath'd is the life that now 
inforced I leade." Earlier still in Peele, 
Arraignment of Paris, Prologue : — 
" Done be the pleasure of the 

powers above, 
Whose bests men must obey " 
(1584). See too a passage at the close 
of Lodge's Wounds of Civil War (Haz- 
Ijtt's Dodsley, vii. 196). See note 
below at 11. v. 74, and Introduction. 
These inversions occur elsewhere in 
Peele's writings frequently. Spenser 
set the fashion. See too Sonnet Ixxi. : 
" When I perhaps compounded am with 
clay." 

4. Astrcra] We are to make four 
syllables of this ; the name of the 
Goddess of Justice. Golding can only 
afford her two : — 

" All godlynesse lyes under foote. 

And Lady Astrey cast 
Of heavenly vertues from this earth 

in slaughter drowned past " 
(Ovid's Metamorphoses, i. i6g, 170). 
Peele wrote a pageznt, Discensus Astra ce, 
to the Lord Mayor of London's entry, 
1591: '' Astraa, daughter of the im- 
mortal Jove." Elsewhere he speaks 
of " Eliza's court, Astrcetv's earthly 
heaven " {Anglorum Ferice). Her in- 
troduction is 'characteristic of Peele. 

6. Adonis' garden] Spenser's Farie 
Queene (in. vi.) gives a poetical account 
of "The Gardin of Adonis, farrenowmed 
by fame " (in. vi. 29) : — 

" There is continuall spring, and 

harvest there 
Continuall, both meeting at one 

tyme ; 



f 2, 3, .}• 



G. garden] Ff; gardens 



VoT both the boughes doe laughing 
blossomes beare, 

And with fresh colours decke the 
wanton Pryme, 

And eke attonce the heavy trees 
they clyme. 

Which seeme to labour under their 
fruites lode " 
(stanza xlii.). Gabriel Harvey has a 
bitter passage in which he says : " Arte 
. . . beganne to sproute in M. Robert 
Greene. . . . Witt ... to blossome 
in M. Pierce Pennilesse, as in the riche 
garden of poor Adonis : both to growe 
to perfection in M. Thomas Nashe . . . 
proper men, handsome giftes." Fas- 
tidious Brisk in Jonson's Every Man 
out of his Humour, iv. vi., says that in 
Court a man " shall behold all the 
delights of the Hesperides, the Insula; 
Fortunata;, Adonis' Gardens, Tempe, or 
what else." In Cynthia's Revels, v. iii., 
Mercury says to Cupid : " Remember 
thou art not now in Adonis' gardin, 
but in Cynthia's presence where thorns 
lie in garrison about the roses." 
Neither this classical allusion, nor that 
to Astraea, are found again in Shake- 
speare (except in Titus Andronicus, iv. 
iii. 4). Pliny referred to this garden, 
XIX. iv. (p. 10, trans. Holland, bk. ii.) : 
" Auncient writers, who had nothing 
(to speake of) in more account and 
admiration in old time than the gardens 
of the Hesperides, of Adonis, and 
Aicinous." There was a battle fought 
over the existence of these gardens in 
earlier classical writers, amongst four 
critics (Bentley, Theobald, Dr. Pearce 
and Warburton), with reference to a 
passage in Milton, which will be found 
told in Steevens' Shakespeare, at this 
line. It appears that Adonis had no 
garden, only a few flower-pots after his 
death. But its existence in the writings 
of such scholars as Harvey and Jonson 
establishes the tradition, apart from 
Pliny's words.

of Memphis Dyce (Capell conj.). 



II. Why ring not o«<] Perhaps the 
line should read " Ring out the bells," 
etc. But Steevens' remark that aloud 
is redundant is to the point. 

II, 12. bells . . . bonfires] See Part 
II. V. 1.3: "Ring, bells, aloud: burn 
bonfires, clear and bright."' Marlowe 
has similar rejoicing in Tamburlaine, 
Part 1. III. iii. : — 

" Now will the Christian miscreants 
be glad, 
Ringing with joy their superstitious 

bells, 
And making bonfires for my over- 
throw." 

14. 15. celebrate . . . with mirth and 
joy] Compare Greene, Alphonsus (Gros- 
art, xiii. 364) : — 

" Let us marche with speed 
Into the Citie, for to celebrate 
With mirth and ioy this blisful 
festiuall " 
(11. 852-54). The repetition of the com- 
monplace word "joy " here is Greene's 
foible. Note "for to" also in the 
quotation. 

15. replete with] See i. i. 11 (note). 

16. play'd the mcn]A.n old expression, 
frequent in Grafton (1569) : " Ceassyng 
not to say vnto them with a loude 
voyce that the same day if they woulde 
play the men a little while, they should 
confirme unto them," etc. (i. 135). 

20. shall in procession . . .] Compare 
this line with Contention lines iv. ix. 
23, 24, in Part II. (Shakespeare Society, 
p. 62). And see Grafton's Continua- 
tion 0/ Hardyng (p. 459), 1543 : " When 



Kinge Edward had thus overcome them, 
he went to London, and ther for iii. 
dayes caused procession to bee through 
evTye place after the moost solempne 
and devoute fassyon." 

21, 22. pyramis . . . Than Rhodope's 
or Memphis'] Capell's conjecture "of 
Memphis " is very reasonable. The 
illustration is almost certainly from 
Greene. In Mamillia (Grosart, ii. 270) 
he says : " they which came to Memphis 
thought they had scene nothing unlesse 
they had viewed the Pyramides built 
by Rhodope " ; and again (p. 280) ; 
"That flourishing and beautiful dame 
Rodophe which married old Sampniti- 
cus the King of Metnphis " ; and p. 200 : 
" Was not Rodope in the prime of her 
youth counted the most famous or 
rather the most infamous strumpet of 
all Egypt ? . . . yet in the floure of 
her age being married to Psammeticus 
the king of Memphis ... so chast a 
Princes." And in The Debate between 
Follie and Love (iv. 219): "What 
made Rodope huWdc the Pyramides . . . 
but Follie ? " In Planetomachia, 1585 
(Grosart, v. 104), Saturn's tragedy is 
the story of Rhodope told at great 
length. In several other places Greene 
refers to her, making her a favourite 
in his writings. See Pliny's Natural 
History, xxxvi. 12. Marlowe refers to 
the " Pyramides" several times, and to 
the mountain Rhodope, and to Memphis, 
all in different collocations. Spenser 
also uses Rhodope (the mount) in Faerie 
Qneene, bk. ii.

25. rich-jewell'd coffer] Malone re- 
fers to Puttenhani's Arte of Encrlish 
Poesie, 1589 ; the passage will be found 
in Arber's reprint, pp. 31, 32 : "In what 
price the noble poemes of Homer were 
holden with Alexander the Great, inso- 
much as euery night they were layd 
under his pillow, and by day were 
carried in the rich jewell coffer of 
Darius, lately before vanquished by him 
in battaile." "The coffer" was especially 
applied to a strong treasure-box. 
" Chestes made of ivery. In coffers 
these put nothing els save yellow 
glistring golde " (Timothie Kendall 
(1577), Flowers of Epigramines, reprint, 
p. 63). Shakespeare's indebtedness to 
Puttenham appears in Love's Labour's 
Lost several times. See Part II. i. iv. 
62. See also Plutarch's Life of Alex- 
ander the Great. 

26. high festivals] Compare Grafton 
(i. 203) : " the Archebishop the next day 
addressed him to the Masse of S. 
Stephen with all solemnitie, as though 
it had bene an high fesUuall day." 

28, 29. Saint Denis . . . France's 
saint] " When the noble King Charles 
of Fraunce had heard his sisters lamen- 
tation ... he most comfortably spake 
... by the fayth I owe to God and 
Saint Denise, I shall right well provyde 
for you some remedy" (Grafton, Ed- 
7oard the Second, i. 317). According 
to some writers, the saint belonged to 



Paris : " Had not everie citie in all the 
popes dominions his severall patrone ? 
As Paule for London, Denis for Paris, 
Ambrose for Millen, Loven for Gaunt, 
Romball for Machline, S. Marks lion 
for Venise, the three magician kings 
for Cullen, and so of other " (R. Scot, 
Disc, of Witchcraft (reprint, p. 442), 
1584). In a preceding line he gives " S. 
Michael for France." 

30, 31. let us banquet . . . victory] 
The proper ending for a victory in 
Marlowe's way. Compare Taniburlaine, 
Part I., end of Act iii. : — 

" Come bring them in : and for this 
happy conquest 
Triumph and solemnize a martial 
feast." 
And Part II., end of i. i. : — 

" Come banquet and carouse with us 
a while 
And then depart we to our terri- 
tories." 
And end of i. iii. : — 

" Then will we triumph, banquet and 
carouse . . . 
Come, let us banquet and carouse 
the whiles." 
And end of 11. iii. : — 

" With full Natolian bowls 
Of Greekish wine, now let us 

celebrate 
Our happy conquest and his angry 
fate." 
A handy way to clear the stage.

SCENE I. — Before Orleans. 

Enter to the gates, a French Sergeant, and two Sentinels. 

Serg. Sirs, take your places and be vigilant. 
If any noise or soldier you perceive 
Near to the walls, by some apparent sign 
Let us have knowledge at the court of guard. 

First Sent. Sergeant, you shall. [Exit Sergeant. 

Thus are poor servitors, 5 
When others sleep upon their quiet beds, 
Constrain'd to watch in darkness, rain, and cold. 

Enter Talbot, BEDFORD, BURGUNDY, and Forces, with 
scaling-ladders ; their drums beating a dead march. 

Tal. Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy, 



4. court of guard] watch-post, station 
occupied by soldiers on guard. See 
note to Othello, ii. i. 219 (Arden edition, 
p. 82). In a passage there quoted from 
Greene's Orlando Fiirioso, I remarked 
it was the earliest example of the 
Shakespearian spelling, or corruption, 
of the original expression "corps de 
gard." But Greene has it yet earlier 
in Menaphon (Grosart, vi. 120), 1589: 
" the Portcullis was let downe, the 
bridge drawen, the Court of garde, 
thether I went." He has it again in 
Orpharion (xii. 58), 1588-89 (?): " hee 
marched closely and secretly to the 
Campe of Sertorius, where he arrived 
about midnight : using new pollicy, 
that before had conquered with prow- 
esse, for that killing the watch and 
Sentonell, hee pa.st the Courte of Garde, 
and set upon the souldiers, making a 
great slaughter of such men as were 
sleepie and amaz'd." The passage in 
Orlando Furioso (Grosart, xiii. 134-35) 
is quite parallel with the present posi-. 
tion. Orlando surprises a sleeping 
bentinel who is in sympathy with him, 



on the walls of a castle, and he is 
warned to keep clear of the " Round of 
Court of Gard." In this case the 
" guard " is " pitched within a trench 
of stones." 

5. servitors] those who served in the 
wars, soldiers. Ben Jonson uses it so 
twice in Every Man in his Humour. 
Knowell says to Bobadile (iii. i.) : " then 
you were a servitor at both, it seems, 
Strigonium, and what do you call't." 
And in Thos. ^andtTs' Voyage to Tripoli 
(Hakluyt, ed. i8it, ii. 308), 1583: "A 
Spaniard called Sebastian, which had 
bene an old servitour in Flanders." 
See 3 Henry VI. in. iii. 196, for an ex- 
ample from Hall's Chronicle. 

7. drums heating a dead march] 
This is explained by line 4 of the next 
scene, at the next appearance of Talbot. 
They are bringing Salisbury on a 
funeral procession. All historically 
untrue. In yeronimo (Hazlitt's Dodsley, 
iv. 377) is an earlier dead march. 

8. redoubted Burgundy] Occurs 
again as a title of address in Richard II.

elsewhere in Shakespeare. It replaces 
the earlier " renowned," and I don't 
find it in Greene. Like several other 
expressions {e.g. "proud insulting"), 
which will be grouped together later 
on, they point at least to Shakespeare's 
continuous authorship or final prepara- 
tion. " Baleful," a few lines below, is 
another word characteristic of these 
plays, and of Shakespeare's earlier work 
\Romco and jfuliet, Titus Andro)iicus). 
It was a great favourite with Greene. 
10. Walloon] See note, i. i. 137. 

12. caroused and banqueted] Mar- 
lowe's phrase, twice at least, but not 
elsewhere in Shakespeare. See note, 
I. vi. 30, 31. 

13. Embrace we then . . .] "The 
subjunctive of the present, followed by 
we, expressing an invitation = let us " 
(Schmidt, 1343, a). References follow, 
showing that the figure is much more 
prevalent in those three plays than 
elsewhere in Shakespeare. See iii. 
ii. 102 ; III. iii. 68. Compare Selimus 
(Greene ?) (Grosart, xiv. 209) : " But 
go we Lords, and solace in our campe." 
"Go we" seems to be the starting 
point of this old form. It occurs 
oftenest (Kiii^ jfohn, Richard III., 
Merchant of Venice, etc.). I find " Go 
we to it and be we strong " (Towneley 
Mysteries, p. 221, circa 1400) ; and 
again pp. 65, 315, etc. And in Man- 
kind (Early English Dramatists) " Go 
we hence" occurs several times (pp. 8, 
9, etc.). See " Stay we no longer," Part 
III. II. i. 199. 



14. to quittance'] to repay in kind, 
requite. Not a common verb and not 
elsewhere in Shakespeare. Greene 
seems to be responsible for it in this 
sense, and uses it frequently: " <o 
quittance all my ils " occurs in Orlando 
Furioso (Grosart, xiii. 140, line 533) ; 
and "^0 quittance all thy wrongs" is 
found later (p. 186) in the same play. 
He has it again in Philomela, and else- 
where, but it belongs to his latest work. 

15. art] magic. The magic art, or 
art-magic, as it was called. '^ Art 
magicke and sorcery" (Grafton's 
Chronicle (rept., i. 35), 1569). So Peele 
in Old Wives Tale (457, b) : " Without 
this the conjuror could do nothing; 
and so long as this light lasts so long 
doth his art endure." 

17. fortitude] vigour, strength. An 
unusual sense; but see Othello, i. iii. 
222, and note in Arden edition, p. 44. 
New Eng. Diet, combines these two as 
" physical or structural strength," with 
one parallel from Eden's Travels, 1553. 
I find a good illustration in Kitig 
Edward the Third, in. iii. : — 

" As with this armour I impale thy 
breast 
So be thy noble unrelenting heart 
Wall'd in with flint of matchless 
fortitude." 
See note at true-born, 11. iv. 27. And 
Hawes' Pastime (1509): "dragon's 
taile of myghiy forty tude.'^ 

22. masculine] There is some quib- 
bling here that is perhaps the better for 
not being intelligible now.

is concerned. After the English were 
compelled to retire from the " Citie of 
Mons" (Grafton, pp. 574, 575), 
through its rulers admitting the French 
captains from outside, they escaped to 
the castle of Saint Vincent, where they 
were sore beset. " But all their har- 
dinesse had not serued, nor all their 
pollicie had not defended them, if they 
had not priuely sent a messenger to 
the Lorde Talbot. . . . The Lorde 
Talbot hering these newes, neyther 
slept nor banquetted but with all 
hast assembled together his valiaunt 
Capitaynes, to the number of vij 
hundred men of warre . . . and . . . 
sent as an espyall Mathew Gough 
... to shewe to his countreymen that 
he was at hande, to be their ayde and 
rescues. Mathew Gough so well sped, 
that priuely in the night he came into 
the Castell, where he knew howe that 
the French men being lordcs of the 



Citie, and now casting no perilles, . . . 
beganne to waxe wanton and fell to 
ryot. . . . When Mathew Gougli had 
knowne all the certainty he priuely 
returned agayne and within a mile of 
the Citie met with the Lorde Talbot, 
and the Lorde Scales ; and made open 
to them all thinges according to his 
credence, which to speede the matter, 
because the day approched, with all 
haste possible came to the posterne 
gate, and alighted from their horses, 
and about sixe of the clock in the 
morning they issued out of the Castle, 
cryeng Saint George, Talbot. The 
Frenchmen which were scarce up, and 
thought of nothing lesse than of this 
sodaine approchement, some rose out 
of their beds in their shirts, and Icpt 
ouer the walles, other ranne naked 
out of the gates for sauing of their 
lives, leaving behinde them all their 
apparell, horses, armour and ryches. 
None was hurte but such, which eyther 
resisted or would not yeelde, whereof 
some were slaine and cast in prison . . . 
the citie of Mons thus being reduced 
into the F-nglish mens hands, the lorde 
Talbot departed to the towne of Alan- 
son " (The VJ Yere). See note at 
court of guard above (line 4) for a 
parallel scene from Greene's Orlando 
Fiirioso, and elsewhere in his works.

39. unready^ undressed. So in Put- 
tenham (Arber, p. 205), 1589: " as he 
that said to a young gentlewoman, 
who was in her chamber making her 
selfe unready, Mistresse will ye geve 
me leave to unlace your peticote." 
Both expressions, " make ready " and 
"make unready," of a person, were in 
familiar use ; the former is still common 
provincially. 

43. followed arms] Only again in 
A'/ng- John, 11. i. 31. It occurs in 
(Peele's) Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dod- 
sley, V. 382) : — 

" And rightly may you follow arms. 
To rid you from these civil 
harms." 
The prevalence of trochaic endings here 
is to be noticed, and in many places in 
this play; as in scene ii. of the last 
Act (f.jo^. I. ii. 70-go). It is char- 
acteristic of Peele. In Jack Straw 
(Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 388) the following 
endings occur : levity, extremity, in- 
jury, reverence, courtesy, policy, de- 
termines so. take in hand — all on a 
single page. They are equally pre- 
valent in Sehmus. Peele adopted 
them perhaps from his favourite Faerie 
Qucene. Occasionally in that great 
poem Spenser gives full swing to them, 
as in II. i. 57: mortality, tyranny, re- 
gality, infirmity, weakest heart, basest 
part. Marlowe took them up also, as 
in Tambiirlaine, Part I. 11. i. For •' fol- 



low arms " in Marlowe, see Tambur- 
Untie, Part II. i. iii. : — 

" But while my brothers /o/Zozt' arms, 
my lord. 
Let me accompany my gracious 
mother." 
44. war-like] warrior-like, soldierly. 
Compare iv. iii. 31, below. 

46. fiend of hell] Occurs again in 
Pericles, iv, vi. 173, and Taming of 
Shrew, i. i. 88. 

47. favour him] support, befriend 
him. See Part III. iv. i. 144. So 
Brutus in his dying speech : " Favour 
my sons, favour these orphans, lords " 
(Locrine, i. i.). 

48. sped] fared, what sort of experi- 
ence he had. A common expression. 
See quotation from Grafton above, at 
line 38. 

49. defensive] See Richard II. n. i. 
48. Not elsewhere in Shakespeare, and 
commoner as a substantive in his time, 
meaning defence (Arcadia, Greene's 
prose works, etc.). 

50. cunning] magical power, skill in 
the black art, supernatural cleverness. 
See below, iii. iii. 10, and Tempest, iii. 
ii. 49. And in " cunning man " com- 
monly. Compare Greene, George-a- 
Grcene (xiv. 157) : " keepe out of my 
circle. Least you be tome in peeces with 
shee devils. Mistres Bettris, once, twice, 
thrice. [He throwes the gown in, and 
she comes out.] Oh is this no cunning ? "

again in Shakespeare. It occurs twice 
in Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage, 
Act v., in the sense of Cotgrave : " Plate- 
forme : f. A platforme, plot, modell" 
(ground-plan). See T. Bowes' transla-

1586 : " Aristotle in his platforme of a 
happy commonwelth" (ch.lxvi.). Very 
frequent in R. Greene's writings. 

77. endamage] damage. In Tzoo 
Gentlemen of Verona, in. ii. 43. Com- 
mon from Chaucer downward, and often 
spelt indamage. 

78. / 'II be so bold to] " Bold " in 
the sense of forward, free with, is fre- 
quent in Shakespeare. 

79. The cry of Talbot] See note, i. i. 
121, and I. iv. 42, 4^ Compare Spen- 
ser's Shephcards Calendar {]unt),Glosse 
(1579): " No otherwise then the P'renche-

(Globe edition, p. 465). Noted by 
Steevens, who also quotes from Drayton 
(see note at i. iv. 42). Greene uses this 
idea in George-a-Greene (Grosart, xiv. 
130, II. 189-192) : — 



" Hath William Musgrove scene an 
hundred yeres ? 
Have I becne feared and dreaded 

of the Scottes, 
That when they heard my name in 

any roade 
They fled away and posted thence 
amaine ? " 
In Saturday Review, Oct. 5, 1907, a 
translation of a French nursery rhyme 
heard recently at Rouen is given — sung 
as a lullaby to quiet babes, the name 
being Wellington. See below, 11. iii. 16. 
80. loaden] Compare Marlowe, Tam- 
burlainr. Part 1. 1. i. : — 

" milk white steeds of mine. 
All loaden with the heads of killed 
men." 
And in Grafton's Continuation of liar- 
dyng, 1543 (p. 573): "So loden with 
praies and spoiles." Often in this con- 
nection.

3. [Retreat sounded] Capell ; Retreat Ff. 
center F 2. 



Leaps from the Antarctic world unto

And dims the welkin with her pitchy

These lines are interesting, since they 
are found almost word for word in the 
old play The Taming of a Shrew, circa 
1594 {Six Old Plays, p. 16, Act i. sc. i.). 
Shakespeare has "pitchy day" in 3 
Henry VI. v. vi. 85. and ^'pitchy night " 
later in All's Well, iv. iv. 24. See 
Fcurie Queene, i. v. 20 for this passage. 

2. ovcr-veil'd] Shakespeare was very 
fond of the prefix " over," especially in 
his earlier work. " O'er " prevails with 
him later. Greene and Spenser led him 
the w"ay with " over." 

3. sound retreat] See Part II. iv. viii. 
4 and note. A favourite phrase in the 
historical plan's. And in Marlowe, Tam- 
burlaine. Part II. i. i. : " And they will, 
trembling, sound a quick retreat." 

5. advance] raise (Schmidt). But 
perhaps " bring forward." In connec- 
tion with the "dead march" in the 
stage direction at 11. i. 7, it seems there 
is some sort of funeral procession in- 
tended here, preliminary to the erection 
of the tomb (line 13). 

5. market-place] an open space in the 
middle of a town ; commonly referred 
to as the public place par excellence. 
Thus Greene in Euphues His Censure 
(Grosart, vi. 280): "calling the soul- 



diers by sounde of a Trumpet to the 
market place : hee discoursed unto 
them." 

J. paid my vow unto his soul] Steevens 
quotes from the old play of King 
John .— 

" Thus hath King Richard's son per- 
form'd his vow 
And offered Austria's blood for 

sacrifice 
Unto his father's ever-living soul." 

10. hereafter] used adjectively again 
in Richard III. iv. iv. 390: "hereafter 
time." 

18. massacre] A new word at this 
time, and found only in Shakespeare, 
in the historical plays (i Henry IV., 1 
Henry VI. and Richard III.) and Titus 
Andronicus. Marlowe has both verb 
(once) and substantive (title). Greene 
has both .so often in his plays that the 
word is quite characteristic of them. 
He took it from the translation of Prim- 
audaye's French Academic (1586), the 
earlier example in New Eng. Diet. 
Greene uses the noun in The Spanish 
Masqucrado, 1589 (Grosart, v. 282), 
and in Euphues His Censure (vi. 254). 
But Spenser has "And Bangor with 
massacred martyrs fill " {Faerte Queene, 
in. iii. 35) and "huge massacres" (in. 
xi. 29), probably earliest, and note accent. 

ig. / muse] I wonder — a thoroughly 
Shakespearian line ; half-a-dozen lines

Occurs in Golding's Ovid, and twice in 
Faerie Quccne, hk. i. 

21. co/i/ifrf^ra/^5] associates, generally 
of an evil kind, with reference to the 
old legal use, accomplice. But it has 
not always the ill sense in Shakespeare. 
Sidney's Arcadia, "his old friend and 
confederate, the king Basilius," affords 
an example of the best use (ally), at the 
beginning of bk. v. 

23. drotvsy] inclining to sleep, as in 
Spenser's Faerie Qtieene, 11. iii. i : 
" Sir Guyon . . . Uprose from ^rozfsje 
couch." Compare Othello, iii. iii. 
332. 

24. troops of armed men'\ a phrase 
from The Contention. See Part II. iii. 
i. 314 (note). And in Kyd's Cornelia, 
ii. 173. 

27. dusky vapours] "dusky sky" 
occurs in i? Henry VI. iii. li. 104. 
"Dusky" is a rare word at this time. 
The expression in the text occurs in 
Greene's Never too Late (Grosart, viii. 
68), 1590: — 

" The Welkin had no racke that 
seemed to glide, 
No duskie vapour did bright 
Phoebus shroude." 



20 



25 



30 



35 



There is a well-known passage in Mar- 
lowe's Edward the Second (Uyce, 208, 
b, ed. 1859) : — 

" Gallop apace, bright Phoebus, 
through the sky ; 
And dusky Night, in rusty iron car. 
Between you both shorten the 
time, I pray "; 
which Shakespeare made use of in 
Romeo and Juliet, in. ii. i, " dusky 
night " being " cloudy night " at line 4. 
Marlowe has the term again in The 
Massacre at Paris. And Greene again 
in Euphues His Censure (vi. 233) : 
" The gladsome yares of Phoebus had 
no sooner shaken of, by the consent of 
blushing Aurora, the dusky and dark- 
some Mantle that denied Tellus and 
Flora the benefits of Tytan " (1587). 
Golding however is earliest, with 
" Duskie Plutoe's cmptie Realme " 
(Ovid, Metamorphoses, iv. 629), and 
"duskie nyght" {ibid. xv. 35, 1567). 
Spenser prelers duskish. 

28. trull] courtesan, harlot. Shake- 
speare gives this meaning in Burgundy's 
.'peech at 111. ii. 45. '1 here is usually 
the sense of lewdness. Greene has the 
word very frequently. 

29, 30. arm in arm . . . running. Like 
. . . turtle-doves] Marlowe puts this 
more poetically in Tatnburlaine, Part I. 
v.: " W'hat, are the turtles fray'd out 
of their nests ? "

Bed. No, truly, it is more than manners will ; 

And I have heard it said, unbidden guests 55

36. realm of France'] This expression 
occurs some ten times in the three plays, 
Henry V., and First and Second Henry 
VI. A quotation in New Eng. Diet. 
from Lidgate gives the phrase, but it is 
side by side with " reahn of England." 
However, I find it in Piers the Plowman, 
ed. Skeat, vol. i. p. 17, line 192 (ante 
1377) : "for al the realme of Fraunee." 
And in Grafton, i. 576, 1569. Grafton 
reports that Edward the Third " Sayde 
that in hys opinion there was no Realme 
to be compared to the Realme of 
Frauncc" (i. 335). 

41. lies] dwells. 

43. fills the world with] See below, 
V. iv. 35, and Part III. v. v. 44. 

45. comic] ludicrous, raising mirth. 
See 3 Henry VI. v. vii. 43: "stately 
triumphs, mirthfuU comie shows." New 
Eng. Diet, overlooks these two pas- 
sages. Compare Greene, Orlando 
Furioso (Grosart, xiii. 43) : " We must 
lay plots of stately tragedies, Strange 
Comtek showes." 

48. a world of men] an immense 
number. A favourite expression in 
Shakespeare, occurring throughout. 
It occurs in Greene's Alphonsus, King 
of Arragon (Grosart, xiii. 349): — 
" Such terror have their strong and 
sturdie blowes 



Strooke to their hearts, as for a 
world of gold, 

I warrant you, they will not come 
againe." 
Ben Jonson and all later poets adopt it, 
Jonson varies it in one of his Masques, 
1608 (Cunningham's Gifford, iii. 37, a): 
" girdles, gyrlonds, and worlds of such 
like " (heaps). See too Marlowe's 
Tamburlainc, Part II. i. i : " He brings 
a world of people to the field." 

49. oratory] eloquence. Compare 
Lncrece, 564, and Titus Andronicus, 
V. iii. 90. These are the earliest illus- 
trations in New Eng. Diet, of this 
sense of persuasiveness. 

50. over-ruled] prevailed in opinion. 
The earliest instance of this meaning 
in New Eng. Diet. See note at over- 
veil'd, II. ii. 2. See Venus and Adonis, 
109. 

54. waK«frs] " good manners." Com- 
pare Greene, Carde of Fancie (Grosart, 
iv. 21), 1584-1587: "so shall all men 
have cause to prayse thee for thy 
manners and commend thee for thy 
modestie." New Eng. Diet, has an 
example from Lyly's Euphues, which is 
hardly parallel. 

55. unbidden guests] were evidently 
a current nuisance. Chapman has " I 
see unbidden guests are boldest still "

Count. And he is welcome. What ! is this the man ? 

Mess. Madam, it is. 

Count. Is this the scourge of France ? 

Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad 1 5 

That with his name the mothers still their babes ? 

I see report is fabulous and false : 

I thought I should have seen some Hercules, 

A second Hector, for his grim aspect. 

And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs. 20 

Alas! this is a child, a silly dwarf: 

It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp 

Should strike such terror to his enemies. 
Ta/. Madam, I have been bold to trouble you ; 

But since your ladyship is not at leisure, 25 

I '11 sort some other time to visit you. 



14. scourge of France'] See extract 
from Spenser, 11. ii. 79 note. 

16. That with his name] See note, 
I. iv. 42, 43. See also iv. ii. 16. See 
above, 11. i. 79, note at " The cry of 
Talbot." 

18, 19. Hercules, A second Hector, for 
his grim aspect] Both Hercules and 
Hector were favourite heroes with 
Shakespeare, and are very often men- 
tioned in affectionate and commenda- 
tory language. Hector in particular 
was dear to his heart, apart from the 
Troilus and Cressida representation. 
" Grim aspect " has not here the sense 
it now would have, of ugly, forbidding. 
Rather it means awe-inspiring, inflexibly 
stern, determined looking as befits a 
warrior. Shakespeare is very fond of 
the word, with varied shades of mean- 
ing. " Grim, sir " was a common ex- 
pression in the ten years before and 
after this play, and it meant very little 
more than dignified, grave, austere. 
Marston has : " outstare the terror of thy 
grim aspect " in Antonios Revenge, in. v. 
(1602). " Second" in the sense in this 
line occurs again in Merchant of Venice 
(" A second Daniel ") and in Taming of 
Shrew (" a. second Grissel "). Greene 
has a passage about Hector in Euphues 
His Censure to Philautus iGrosart, vi. 
234); "Next to these, Hector, whose 
countenance threatned warres, and in 
whose face appeared a map of martiall 
exploits." Greene uses *' second " in 
the above sense : " she should send us 
a second Adonis to delude our senses" 
(Menaphon (Grosart, vi. 96), 1589). See 
Alcides (note), iv. vii. 60. Hall, the 



Chronicler (1548), at the beginning ol 
" The XXXI Yere," calls Talbot " Thys 
Englishe Hector and marcial flower." 
20. strong-knit] Compare " weW-knit" 
in Love's Labour's Lost, i. ii. 77. No 
early examples of " knit " in compound, 
excepting these two, are known to me. 
" Well-^«i/ Achilles" is used (by Kyd) 
in Soliman and Perseda, v. iii. 72. 

22. writhled shrimp] For " shrimp,' 
see Love's Labour's Lost, v. ii. 582, and 
note, Arden edition, p. 163. "Writhled " 
occurs in Marston's Scourge of Villainy 
(Bullen, iii. 326): "Cold, writhled eld, 
his life-sweat almost spent." It seems 
to be a strengthened form of " \vrithen " 
(twisted) with the idea of wrinkled 
thrown in. Nashe has " riueld [rivelled] 
barke, or outward rynde of a tree " 
{Terrors of Night (Grosart, iii, 257), 
1594); and on the same page: "the 
palme of his hand is wrythen and 
pleyted." He also has "wrinkled- 
faced " and " writhen-faced.'' Steevens 
gives the word from Spenser: "Her 
writhled skin, as rough as maple rind." 
Craig quotes from Gascoigne, Poesies 
(1575) : " My writhled cheekes betray 
that pride of heat is past " (Poesies, ed. 
Cunlifi"e, p. 43). In Spenser the word 
is " wrizled." 

23. strike such terror] See quotation 
from Jack Straw, below, iii. iv. 10-12. 
And Richard II L v. iii. 217. See also 
Locrine, v. i, quoted at "pillars of the 
state," Part II. i. i. 75. 

26. sort some other lime] choose some 
other time fittingly. Compare Two 
Gentlemen of Verona, iii. ii. 92, and 
Romeo and Juliet, iv. ii. 34.

Shakespeare, as in Love's Labour's

(see Skeat) is the primary sense, mean- 
ing pure-lilind; later confused with 
" pore," as if poring. 

22. apparell'd] decked out, adorned. 
A common figurative use. See Comedy 
of Errors, in. ii. 12. 

25. tongue-tied\ A favourite expres- 
sion, occurring a dozen times in Shake- 
speare. It occurs again in 3 Henry VI. 
and in Richard III. I have notes of 
it in Palsgrave, 1530 ; in Nashe's Have 
with you to Saffron IValdcn (Grosart, 
iii. 47), 1596 ; and twice in Lvly's 
Woman in the Moone (circa 1580), Fair- 
holt's edition, pp. 158, 161. 

26. significants] signs, symbols. In 
dumb show. Compare Peele, " Louely 
London " Pageant, 15S5 : " .\nd offer 
. . . this emblem thus in show signifi- 
cant." See the use of the word in 
Love's Labour's Lost, iii. i. 131. The 
word here may be equated with signifi- 
cance. There was a strange confusion 
in certain words, owing to identity of 
sound, which is to be noticed. See my 
note to assistants in Love's Labour's 
Lost, V. i. 113 {.\rden ed., p. 120), 
where I give a quotation from Nashe 
(Grosart, iv. 256) for the word '■ observ- 
ants " = observance. " Occurrents " 
meaning " occurrence " is not uncom- 
mon. "Exigents" for "exigence" is 
another case in point of this indiscrim- 
inate usage. Pope read significance. 



27. true-born gentleman] " true-born 
Englishman " is in Richard II. i. iii. 
309. " True-born sovereign occurs 
twice in Act iii. scene iii. of King 
Edicard the Third, a play which bears 
evident marks of Shakespeare's hand.

See Merry Wives of Windsor, n. ii. 21

the expression from Nashe's Pierce 
Penilesse (Grosart, ii. 15), 1592. It 
occurs earlier in Harvey (nearly) ; 
" Standinge altogether uppon termes 
of honour and exquisite forms of 
speaches " (Letters (Grosart, i. 122), 
1573-81). "Stand upon points" and 
" stand upon terms " both occur in 
Greene's plays.

IV. ii. 156: "I do fear colourable 
colours." In 2 Henry IV. v. v. 91, 
the quibble is with " collar." '• I fear 
no colours" contains yet another 
quibble (on flags, ensigns, etc.), and 
became a very common expression a 
little later than this play (Twelfth 
Night, Ben Jonson's Sejanus, etc.).

Greene, George-a-Greene (xiv. 154, 1. 
743) : " He proue it good upon your 
carcasses." Frequent in Shakespeare. 

100. partaker] supporter — one who 
takes a part. Not found again in Shake- 
speare. Sidney used it in Arcadia 
(ante 1586) : " no more solemnized by 
the tears of his partakers than by the 
blood of his enemies" (bk. ii.). It 
occurs in the chroniclers Hall and 
Grafton. See quotation at iii. i. 90. 

loi. note you in my book of memory] 
Compare " table of my memory," Ham-

A Poem in Praise of Chastity from 
Phoenix Nest (1593). But not parallel. 

102. apprehension] notion, view, idea 
upon the subject. Very likely Holo- 
fernes' sense in Love's Labour's Lost, 
IV. ii. 63. 

103. u)ell warn'd] soundly lectured 
and cautioned. Compare Locrine, iii. 
3 : " You have your rhetoric so ready at 



your tongue's end, as if you were never 
well warned when you were young." 

108. cognizance] badge. " He made 
a law also the same time, against the 
excessive takyng of Vsurie by the lewes, 
and that they should weare a certaine 
cognisauncc upon their uppermost gar- 
ment, whereby they should be knowne 
from Christians" (Grafton, i. 285, Ed- 
ivard the First, The VIIJ Yere). And 
again (p. 300): "there met her sixe 
hundreth Citizens in one Lyuery of red 
and white, with the cognisaunce of 
diuers misteries [trades] brodered vpon 
their sleues." 

108. blood-drinking] See the last line 
of this scene. Craig compares King 
John, III. i. 342, 343 ; Steevens cites 
" Dry sorrow drinks our blood" from 
Romeo and Juliet, iii. v. 59. See too 
" blood- drinking sighs," 2 Henry VL 
III. ii. 63, and "blood-drinking pit," 
Titus Andronicus, 11. iii. 224. 

112. chok'd with thy ambition] A 
favourite expression. See below, 11. v. 
123 and Part II. in. i. 143. This sort 
of moral suffocation occurs several times 
in other plays of Shakespeare, and 
seems to be rather peculiar to him.

" Take her I say, and live King Ncsfors

as Nfstor, in name three ages of men." 
And Peele's Polvhymnia, 1590: "the 
noble English Nestor's sons " (line 177). 

7. Edmund Mortimer] was made 
prisoner bv Owen Glendower in the 
first year of Henry the Fourth (Grafton, 
p. 4S5) : " he also made warre upon 
the Lo.de Edmond Mortimer, Erie of 
Marche . . . and toke him prisoner, 
and fettered him in Cheynes, and cast 
him in a deepe and miserable Dun- 
geon." And later, in the fourth year 
of Henry the Sixth (p. 560) : " During 
which season Edmond Mortimer, the 
last Erie of Marche of that name (which 
long time had been restrained from his 
libertie and finally waxed lame) de- 
ceassed without issue, whose inherit- 
aunce descended to Lord Richard 
Plantagenet, sonne and heyre to Rich- 
ard Erie of Cambridge, behedded as 
you have heard before, at the towne 
of Southhampton. Which Richard, 
within lesse then XXX yeres as heyre 
to this Erie Edmond . . . claymed ye 
crowne and sceptre of this Realme." 
" This season," is the Parliament 
which arranged the dilTerences between 
Gloucester and Winchester. There is 
no occasion here to enter into the 
disputed question as to the identity 
of this Edmund Mortimer, who was 
apparently confounded with his kins- 
man by the author of this play, and 
by the old historians. See Steevens' 
Shakespeare, ix. 569-73, 1793. It is 
dealt with by Ritson, Malone and 
Steevens. 

8. lamps vrhose wasting <m7] Compare 
Richard II. i. iii. 221 : — 

" My o»/-dried lamp and time- 
bewasted light 
Shall be extinct with age." 

8, g. eyes . . . Wax dim] Compare 
Peele, Arraignment of Paris (369, a, 
Dyce), 1584: "Then first gan Cupid's 
eyesight wexen dim." And his Tale of 



Troy (556, a) 1589 : " The Trojans 
glory now gan xfcixcn dim." And 
(Peele and Greene's) Locrinc, i. i : — 
" Mine eyes wax dim o'ercast with 
clouds of age." 

9. exigent] end, extremity. Com- 
pare Sidney's Arcadia, bk. ii. (ed. 
1738, p- 184): "Now was Zelmane 
brought to an exigent, when the King 
turning his eyes that way." And 
Greene, Philomela (Grosart, xi. 200) : 
•• I, even I that committed the deede, 
though to the exigent of mine own 
death, could not but burst foorth." 

10. overborne with . . . grief]GTeene 
has the line " Assaild with shame, 
with horror overborne," twice in A 
Looking Glnsse for London (xiv. 96, 
97). Not illustrated in New Eng. Diet., 
and Shakespeare has no parallel for 
" overborne with." See below, iii. i. 

sa- 
il. PJ/A/«s] strengthless . Compare 
Othello, I. iii. 83, the primary sense of 
" pith " being marrow. Compare 
" crestless," 11. iv. 85. 

II. like to a wither'd vine] Compare 
Peele, Polyhymnia (569, a) : — 

" Oershadowed with a wither'd run- 
ning vine 
As who should say, my spring of 
youth is past." 
Marlowe is fond of this simile — of a 
king. He has it twice in Edward the 
Second : — 

" This Spenser, as a putrefying 
branch 
That deads the royal vine " 
(204, b). And again : — 

" So shall not England's vine be per- 
ished 
But Edward's name survive" 
(213, a). 

11. 12, 13. pithless . . . sapless . . . 
strengthless] This assemblage of new 
compounds is remarkable, and this 
scene (like the last) being assuredly 
all Shakespeare's is worthy of close 
attention. " Sapless " occurs again (iv. 
V. 4) below ; "strengthless" is in Lucrece, 
709, and Venus and Adonis, 153, and

And even since then hath Richard been obscured, 

Depriv'd of honour and inheritance : 

But now the arbitrator of despairs.

With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence. 30 

I would his troubles likewise were expired. 

That so he might recover what was lost. 

ig. unto his\ F i ; A»s Ff 2, 3, 4 ; to his Rowe. 



2 Henry I\\ i, i. 141. We are re- 
minded of Marlowe here, who rejoiced 
in these terms. He uses remediless, 
timeless, ruthless, quenchless, remove- 
less, expressless, resistless, hapless. 
Needless to say it is only this peculiar- 
ity recalls Marlowe here — nothing of 
the style. And Golding had already 
(Ovid's Metamorphoses) used wiveless, 
knotless, hurtless, luckless, pleasureless, 
tongueless, lightless, headless, heedless, 
helpless. See Introduction. 

13. numb'\ An uncommon word in 
Shakespeare, occurring again only in 
Titus Andronicus and Richard III. 
" Numbed ' is in Lear. Compare Peele. 
Old Wives Tale (450, a) :— 

"And brought her hither to revive 
the man, 
That seemeth young and pleasant 

to behold, 
And yet is aged, crooked, weak and 
numb." 
And later (457, a) in the same play : 
" these are my latest days. Alas, my 
veins are numb'd, my sinews shrink." 
Spenser has " My flesh is numb'd with 
fears " in Daphnaida (stanza 60). The 
adjective is earlier (Townely Mysteries) 
in Xew Ens^. Diet. 

15. Swi/t-winged] See again Richard 
III. II. ii. 44. " S'j>ift -winged snakes " 



occurs in Sclimus (Grosart's Greene, 
xiv. 289, 1. 1674). And in Kyd's Soli- 
man and Perseda, 11. ii. 33 : " Thou 
great commander of the swift-ioinged 
winds." 

23. Since Henry Monmouth first 
began to reign] See note at line 7. It 
is quite obvious that Grafton (or Hall) 
supplied the situation. Mortimer's 
being brought forth at the point of 
death from his prison, is a fine dramatic 
conception and not inconsistent with 
what the historian tells. Whether it 
be true history or not is of no conse- 
quence. Shakespeare was not writing 
history. 

25. sequestration] seclusion, separa- 
tion. See Othello, i. iii. 351, note, 
Arden ed., p. 56. See Henry V. i. i. 
58. "Sequester " is a not infrequent 
word at this time, but the term in the 
text seems to be rare outside Shake- 
speare. Properly a legal term. 

28, 29. arbitrator . . . umpire] Com- 
pare Romeo and Juliet, iv. i. 63. where 
" the original signification of deter- 
mination by an umpire is still percept- 
ible" (Schmidt). .And see Troilus and 
Cressida, iv. v. 225. The only two 
examples of figurative use of the word 
in New Eng. Diet.

Mor. Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,

O ! tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks.

And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock, 
Why didst thou say of late thou wert despised ?

Craig quotes from Helyas, Knight of

an Angle (1496) are : " Salamon in his 
parablys saith that a good spryte 
makyth a flowrynge aege, that is a 
fayre aege & a longe." These lines 
(55 to 60) are worthy of note. They 
are remarkably mean, giving a feeling 
of a hand inferior to most of the writing 
in this scene.

have been taken from Camden's Bri-

(p. 725), 161 a, where it is set forth 
more explicitly than in the earlier his- 
torians. Camden goes on, after quot- 



ing "the violent usurpation of Henry 
the Fourth," . . . " The duke immedi- 
ately was transported so headlong with 
ambition that he went about to pre- 
occupate and forestall his owne hopes, 
and so he raised that deadly warre be-

much used by Spenser, Peele, Marlowe, 
and Greene. Spenser perhaps revived 
it from earlier writers. Mr. Woollett 
tells me he has observed it in Gower and 
other early writers. Spenser has it 
often in his most archaic poem. The 
Shepheards Calendar (1579): "if by 
mee thou list advised bee" (June), "for 
he nould warned be " (May), and else- 
where. See above, i. i. 7 and i. vi. 2

Shakespeare. Compare Greene, Tiil- 
lies Love (Grosart, vii. 153) : " I have 
not translated Lentulus letter verbatim 
worde for worde " (15S9). 

15. pestiferous] pernicious, mischiev- 
ous. Occurs again, All's Well, iv. iii. 
340. Greene has it twice at least : 
" no regard of God or man could pro- 
hibit him from his pestiferous purpose " 
{Mamillia, Grosart, ii. 118). Later in 
Mamillia (186) the word has the literal 
sense. See extract from Grafton at iv. 
i. 162-3. 

15. dissentious] quarrelsome. Also a 
word of Greene's : " dissen tious quarrels " 
Planetomachia, v. 85), and else- 
where. 

17. a most pernicious usurer] See note 
about Winchester in Henry the Fifth's 
opinion, at ii. iii. 23, 24. The passage 
quoted there from Grafton (p. 572) states 
further : " he obteyned that dignitie [the 
Cardinalate] to his great profite, and to 
the impouerishing of the spiritualtie. 
For by a Bull Legantine, which he 
purchased at Rome, he gathered so 
much treasure that no man in maner 
had money bqt he, and so was he sur- 
named the rich Cardinall of Win- 
chester." The "Bull Legantine," 
which explains the usury, is also re- 
ferred to, I. iii. 35. This especial usury 
is, I believe, again borne in mind in 
Measure for Measure, in. ii. 7.

26. swelling heart] This line is re- 
peated (nearly) in Titus Andronicus, v. 
iii. 13. And compare Peele's Alcazar, 11. 
iii. : "The fatal poison of my swelling 
heart " where the old printer's confusion 
of " prison " (quarto) occurs. Spenser 
has " hart-swelling hate" [Muiopotmos).

If I were covetous, ambitious, or perverse, 

As he will have me, how am I so poor ? 

Or how haps it I seek not to advance 

Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling ? 

And for dissension, who preferreth peace 

More than I do, except 1 be provoked ? 

No, my good lords, it is not that offends ; 

It is not that that hath incensed the duke : 

It is, because no one should sway but he; 

No one but he should be about the king ; 

And that engenders thunder in his breast, 

And makes him roar these accusations forth.

Ff3, 4- 

42. Thou bastard of my grandfather /] 
The Bishop ofWinchester was an ille- 
gitimate son of John of Gaunt, Duke of 
Lancaster, by Katharine Swynford, 
whom the Duke afterwards married 
(M alone). 

43. /ortf/v] proud, stuck-up. Only in 
Lucrece, 1731 (in a good sense); in 
Richard III. iv. iv. 369 (a doubtful 
reading) ; and in this play and 2 Henry 
VI. several times. Compare Greene's 
Frier Bacon (Grosart, xiii. 54) : — 

" Then lordly sir, whose conquest is 

as great 

In conquering love as Caesars 

victories." 

Peele has " my lordly breast " in Battle 

of Alcazar, n. ii. And in Jack Straw 

(Peele ?) : "Your majesty and all your 

lordly train " (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 392). 

44. imperious] imperial, majestical ; 
used sarcastically and insolently with 
the same sense as lordly. A favourite 
word (seriously) with Marlowe : — 

" For there sits Death ; there sits 
imperious Death, 
Keeping his circuit by the slicing 
edge " 



45. Am I 7wt] Ff I, 2; Am not I 

(Tamburlaiue, Part I. v. i.) ; and again 
in The Massacre at Paris (ed. Dyce, p. 
238, a) :- 

" Am Ithustobejestedatand scorn'd? 
Tis more than kingly or emperious.'" 

45. saucy priest] overbearing, inso- 
lent. Shakespeare was particularly 
partial to this word: " Pla3'ing so the 
sawcye Jacke " is in Golding's Ovid, 
xiii. 289. In Greene. 

47. castle keeps] Compare (Peele's) 
Jack Straw (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 387) : 
" I heard say he would keep the castle 
still for the king's use." And see ex- 
tract from Hall's Chronicle (1548) at 
3 Henry VI. i. ii. 49. 

48. patronage] Greene seems to be 
responsible for this barbaric verb. The 
passage in the text was the earliest in 
biew Eng. Diet, proof, but I was able 
to furnish the following: "Pallas . . . 
the goddesse did mo^t patronage learn- 
ing and souldiers " {Euphues his Censure 
to Philautus (Grosart, vi. 151), 1587). 
He has it in the body of the same tract 
(p. 239): "it is no offence in Pallas

Venus altars to parle of loves : sith

the goddesses doo patronage such 
affections." The previous example is 
from the Epistle Dedicatory ; and 
Greene has the verb in three other such 
epistles, dating about 1589-1590. The 
verb occurs only once elsewhere in 
Shakespeare, in this play, below, iii. iv. 
32- 

51. Rome . . . Roam] See Skeat's 
Etymological Dictionary on this word. 
He has an example of the Romans 
roaming [ramden) as early as Layamoji, 
the word pronounced broad, and akin 
to ramble. The root was distinct, but 
the verb was influenced by the early 
pilgrimages. Steevens found the quibble 
in Nashe's Lenten Sluffe, 1599 : " three 
hundred thousand people romed to Rome 
for purgatorie pils and paternal veniall 
benedictions" (Grosart, v. 247). Rolfe 
says: "Elsewhere Rome seems to be 
pronounced Room. Compare the quib- 
bles in King John, iii. i. 180, and Julius 
Ccesar, i. ii. 156, and the rhymes in 
Lucrece, 715, 1644." Barnaby Googe 
rhymes Rome with come and some in 
The Popish Kingdome, 1570; and with 
groom (spelt grome). In Chaucer's 
Canterbury Tales " roomy " rhymes " to 
me." For the speaker's [Warwick] 
presence in this scene, see note below, 
135. 



53. overborne] borne down, subdued. 
See V. i. 60. " Overborne with " has 
occurred already, 11. v. 10 (note). 

58. touch'd so ttear] concerned so 
closely, as in Two Gentlemen of Verona, 
III. i. 60: — 

" I am to break with thee of some 
affairs 
That touch me near." 
But the expression here is stronger in 
meaning, and identical rather with the 
old "touch one nigh," that is, hit, hurt, 
annoy. Compare Caxton's Reynard the 
Fox, 1481 : "The foxe herde alle thyse 
wordes which touchid hym nygh" 
(Arber, p. 32) ; and again : " And yf I 
may come to speche and may be herde 
I shal so ansuere that I shal touch 
somone nygh ynowh " (Arber, p. 60). 
See Othello, 11. iii. 225, for the sense of 
wounding; and The Rare Triumphs of 
Love and Fortune (Hazlitt's Dodsley, 
vi. 146), circa 1580 : — 

" He hath been lately rubbd and 
touch'd perhaps too near ; 
Which he ne can or will put up 
without revenge." 

63. entertalk with] Explained by 
Schmidt: " engage in, begin " conver- 
sation with lords. But I think it was 
meant to be one word, "enter " stand- 
ing for "inter" as was commonly

the case. Greene has entermeddle, 
enterrupt, etc. Compare " interparleys " 
in Lodge's Euphiics Golden Lcgacie 
(Shaks. Library, p. 80, HazHtt ed.), 
and " interprater " in Lyly's Sapho and 
Phao, IV. iii. But the word itself actu- 
ally occurs in Golding's Ovid (ii. 201), 
1565-67, and there is no better store- 
house of Shakespearian language : — 
" While Phebus and his rechelesse 

Sonne were entertalking this; 
Aebus, Aethon, Phlegon, and the 

firie Pyrois 
The restlesse horses of the Sunne 

began to ney so hie." 
Compare "enterdeale" in Mother Hub- 
berd's Tale (520, a, Globe) ; and " enter- 
blinning" in Sylvester's Du Bartas 
(1591), p. 27, ed. 1626. 

64. have a fling at] have a go, or 
crack at ; make an attempt upon. A 
favourite expression with Greene but 
not found in Shakespeare elsewhere. 
" They must haue one fling at women ? 
dispraysing their nature" (Mamillia 
(Grosart's Greene, ii. 76, 77), 1583). 
" Hearing as he travelled abroad of this 
Marian, did meane to haue a fling at 
her " (Defence of Conny -Catching (xi, 
87), 1592). " Mullidor . . . sayd he 
would ieoparda ioynt, and the next day 
haue a fling at her" [Never too Late 
(viii. 190), 1590); and again (p. 218), "dis- 
sention will haue a fling amongst the 
meanest." NewEng. Diet, gives "have 
theyr false flynges" from Bale, 1550, 
which is not identical, so that the ex- 
pression is of or belonging to Greene. 
Oliphant (who is not reliable) gives 
earlier examples in New English. 



From the " flinging at" (Gabriel Harvey, 
i. 164) or kicking of a horse. Here used 
figuratively, an attack in words, a taunt. 
The expression is also in Kyd's Spanish 
Tragedy, in. xii. 21. 

66. watchmen] guardians. Compare 
Hamlet, i. iii. 46. 

72. viperous] Occurs again in Corio- 
lanus, III. i. 287, and Cymbeline, iii. iv. 
41. Venomous, malignant. Gabriel 
Harvey uses it several times in Pierces 
Supererogation, 1592, 1593. But the 
allusion is to the viper and the mother's 
womb (or bowels) myth. See passage 
from Sylvester quoted in 3 Henry VI. 
II. V. 12. 

72, 73. worm . . . of the common- 
wealth] more familiar as "caterpillar of 
the commonwealth," as in Richard II. 
II. iii. 166. This expression occurs in 
every writer of the time almost, some- 
times with a mocking allusion to 
" pillars of the state," but oftener with a 
reference to the word "piller" (or poller). 
Stephen Gosson used it on his title : 
"Tfie Schoole of Abuse containing a 
pleasaunt invective against Poets, Pipers, 
Plaiers, Testers, and such like cater- 
pillers of a commonwealth" (1579). 
In Polimanteia (1595) it is varied to 
" canker of a commonwclth." Harri- 
son's Description of England, 11. x. (Ne^v 
Shaks. Soc. p. 217), 1577, is the earliest 
I have met : " But in fine, they are all 
theeues and caterpillers in the common- 
wealth, and by the word of God not 
permitted to eat, sith they doo but licke 
thesweat from the true laborers browes." 
Greene has it in several places. 

73. tawny coats] See i. iii. 28.

104. AiuV^ An Dyce (S. Walker conj.). 



Henry IV. 11. iv. 134, and Tayningofa 
Shrew, i. i. 58. A very common term 
in Greene's plays {Grosart,xiii. 124, 138, 
342, 396, 366, etc.) " Inkhorn " in 
this sneering sense is not found in 
Shakespeare. Compare Greene, Mcna- 
phon (Grosart, vi. 82): "an inkhornc 
desire to be eloquent "; and the introduc- 
tion to it by Nashe (1589): "count it 
a great peece of art in 3.x\ inkhorne m?Lr\, 
in anietapsterlietearmes whatever " (vi. 
14). '^Inkhorn terms" and " smellen 
all of the inkehortie " are in Udall's 
Erasmus (1542), p. 243, Robert's re- 
print. 

102. parings of our nails] anything 
pointed if stakes could not be found, 
with allusion to nails as weapons as 
well as to the old proverb for miserli- 
ness : " she will not part with the paring 
of her nayles. She toyleth continually 
foravayles" (Heywood's Proverbs (ed. 
Sharman, p. 79), 1546). " Not h\?,pared 
nayle will hee foregoe " (Hall's Satires, 
IV. iii. 68, 1598). " A wretch, pinch- 
peny, penny- father . . . one that would 
not part with the paring of his nails " 
(Cotgrave, in v. Chiche). "You shall 
fi n de moreover among the G reeke wr i ters, 
not a few, that . . . left not out the 
verie paring of the vcrie nails but they 
could pick out of them some fine Phy- 
sick " (Holland, Plinie, xxviii. i (p. 293), 
1601). The expression occurs in Comedy 
of Errors, iv. iii. 72, in a passage to be 



explained by Scot's Discoverie of Witch- 
craft and not by a reference to Marlowe's 
Faustus as is suggested by Mr. Cunning- 
ham (Arden ed.). The proverb is found in 
Mabbe, Celestina (Act xii.), 1631; and 
in Ray. These references may be ac- 
ceptable, since New Eng. Diet, does 
not help nor the commentators. It is 
quite Shakespearian to re-adapt a popu- 
lar proverbial expression. 

103. pitch a field] See note at i. i. 
116. As distinguished, "plain field," 
seems to have implied the absence of 
stakes. " In so much that at length the 
father and the sonne [William Rufus 
and Robert] met in plaine fielde with 
two great hostes, and eyther with other 
fought a cruell Battail " (Grafton, i. 
166). "Pitch a field" is a common 
expression in Grafton. 

113. repulse] denial, rejection, rebuff. 
New Eng. Diet, has only one example 
(from a Scotch writer, 1555) preceding 
the date of this play. Greene uses it 
of the serious rebuff Mahomet gives, 
" out of the brazen head," to the craving 
priests in y4Z/>/io«s;/s (Grosart, xiii. 381, 
1. 1293) :— 

" Call this sentence back againe. 

Bring not the Priests into this 
dangerous state : 

For when the Turke doth heare of 
this repulse, 

We shall be sure to die the death 
therefore."

171. ^JffjSee again 2 Henry VI. i. i. 
65 ; and compare engirt, which occurs 
a couple of times in this latter play. 
An old form of " gird," to which it was 
giving place. Greene has it in Frier 
Bacon (xiii. 77, 1. 1658): "And girt 
faire England with a wall of brasse." 
And A Looking Glasse for London (xiv. 
51, 1. 1095): "Go ^{>^ thy loines and 
hast thee quickly hence." Peele uses 
the exact expression in Descensus 
Astrcea (1591) : — 

" In whose defence my colours I ad- 
vance, 
And girt me with my sword, and 
shake my lance." 
"Girt" for "girded" was frequent. 
Earlier in Marlowe's Tatnbnrlaine, Part 
11.111.5:— 

" Who means to girt Natolias walls 

with siege. 
Fire the town and over-run the land." 
171-173. / girt thee . . . Duke of 
York] This occurrence is in its historical 
sequence: "when the great fyre of thys 
discention, betweene these two Noble 
personages was thus . . , utterly 
quenched out, and layde vnder boorde. 
. . . For ioy whereof the king caused a 
solempne feast to be kept on whitson 
Sonday, on the which daye he created 
Richard Plantagenet, sonne and heire 
to the Erie of Cambridge (whom his 
father at Hampton had put to execution, 
as you before have heard), Duke of Yorke, 
not foreseeing before, that this prefer- 
ment shoulde be his destruction " (Graf- 
ton, i. 570). These events, as well as 
the death of Mortimer, belong to the 
fourth year of the king. Several of the 
preceding occurrences in this play took 
place in the fifth to the tenth years. 

6 



The crowning in France, which occurs 
here immediately (1. 180, below), belongs 
to the tenth year (after the death of 
Joan). 

176. grudge one thought] "think an en- 
vious thought" (New Eng. Diet., with 
no other example of the construction). 
" To grudge " was commonly used for 
to be inwardly discontented, generally 
with " against," as here. " To grudge a 
thought " is to have a grudging thought. 
" Olympia (although she grudged in- 
wardly, yet being loath to offend) helde 
her peace" {Greene's Menaphon (Grosart, 
vi. in.), 1587). And Grafton's Con- 
tinuation of Hardyng (494): "albeit 
hys hearte grudged that he was not 
afore made of councel in this matter." 

178. ignoble] See v. iv. 7 and note. 

179-183. " It was most apt and mete, 
for the time present, that King Henry 
in his royall person, with a new armie, 
should come downe into Fraunce,partely 
to comfort and visite his awne subjects 
there, partly eyther by feare or favour 
(because a childe of his age and beautie 
doth commonly allure to him the hartes 
of the elder persons) to cause the French- 
men to continue in their due obeysaunce 
towarde him " (Grafton, i. 590. The X 
Yere). In Grafton the removal to 
France, with a great host, takes place 
immediately after these words, and 
"The Coronation of King Henry the 
Sixt in Paris, sacred king of Fraunce," 
followed at once in the year 1431. The 
intimation here is chronologically and 
dramatically misplaced. See scene iv. 
of this Act, and the beginning of the 
next Act. Such jumbling is impossible 
to a play constructed by Shakespeare. 
Dramatically, we are to suppose the

events of the next two scenes take place 
while the king is on his voyage. 

1S3. disanimates] disheartens, dis- 
courages. New Eng. Diet, gives an 
earlier example (1583) from Stubbes' 
Anatomic of Abuses, ii. 39 (New Shaks. 
Soc. i8>2). I find It in Nashe's Christes 
Teares (Grosart, iv. 261) : " They [the 
Romans] with thunder from any enter- 
prise were disanlmated, we nothing are 
amated." An uncommon word. 

190. feigned ashes . . . forg'd love] 
These terms are constantly jingled to- 
gether by Greene : " his great promises 
and smal pertormance, his fained 
faith and forged flatterie " {Mamillia 
(Grosart, ii. 1S3), 1587). "To forge a 
fayned tale" (Alphonsus, Grosart, xiii. 
341, 1. 262). And the first line of the 
Prologue to Selimus : " No fained toy 
noT forged Tragedie " (Grosart, xiv. 193). 
But Peele is in evidence also : " that 
I should forge or feign with you my love 
in aught" {Sir C ly omon, ^g2, a); and 
Spenser : " That feigning dreame, and 
that faire-forged Spright " (i. 2, 2) 

192. fester'd members] A metaphor 
that Greene would have written. Com- 
pare Mamillia (Grosart, ii. 125), 1583 : 
" The surgion, when the festring Fis- 
tuloe hath by long continuance made 
the sound flesh rotten, can neither with 
lenitive plaisters, nor cutting corasives 
be cured : so loue craveth but only time 



to bring the body and mind to bondage." 
See Hall's Chronicle, p. 245. 

195. thai fatal prophecy] Giafton has 
this: "And duryng the time of this 
s.ege was borne at Wyndsore the kings 
Sonne called Henry whose Godfathers 
were lohn Duke of Bedford, and Henry 
Bishop of Winchester, and laquet 
Duches of Holland was Godmother, 
whereof the king was certefyed lyeng 
at the siege of Meaux, at the which he 
much rejoysed, but when he heard of 
the place of his natiuity, whether he 
fantasyed some olde blind prophecie, 
or else iudged of his sonnes fortune, 
he sayde to the Lorde Fitz Hugh his 
Chamberlej'n these wordes. My Lorde, 
Henry borne at Monmouth, shall 
small time reigne and get much ; And 
Henry borne at Wyndsore shall long 
reigne and loose all : But as God wyll, 
so be it" (Reprint, vol. i. p. 545). 

197. sucking babe] Occurs in Gold- 
ing'sOj'ttf, 1565-67. " Sucking child " 
is the Biblical expression. Greene uses 
it ludicrously as here : " the king com- 
manded upon paine of death, none 
should eate for so many dayes, no, not 
the sucking infant " [Looking Glasse 
for London, xiv. 108, 1. 2500). 

198, 199. wifi all . . . lose all] So in 
Grafton's Continuation of Hardy ng, p. 
547(1543): " intendyng vtterly ether to 
lose all or els to wynne all."

Bastard, and Reignier Ff. 



33. Defer no time] The verb occurs 
again 2 Henry VI. iv. vii. 142, and 
doubtfully in Richard III. (Qq neglect). 
Greene has the expression in A Look- 
ing Glasse for London (Grosart, xiv. 80, 
1. 1813):- 

" The houre is nie ; defer not time : 
Who knowes when he shall die ? " 
New Eng. Diet, gives the phrase from 
Hall's Chronicle (1548) and Lyiy's 
Euphiics. See extract from Hall in 3 
Henry VI. 11. i. iii. 

33. delays have dangerous ends] An 
old proverb occurring in various forms. 
Hazlitt quotes from Havelok the Dane : 
" Delay hath often wrought scathe " 
(ed. Skeat, 1. 1352, circa 1300?). And 
see Chaucer, Troilus and Cresside, iii. 
122. And Lyly, Euphues (Arber, p. 65), 
1579: "Delays breed dangers." Gas- 
coigne gives the Latin : " I found , . . 
that this prouerbe was all too true, 
Omnismora trahit periculum" (Princely 
Pleasures at I'Cenihvorth, 1575, Nichols' 
Progresses, ed. 1823, i. 516). And 
Greene, Alphonsus (Grosart, xiii. 373, 
I. 1080):— 

" I see tis time tolooke about, 
Delay is dangerous and procureth 
harme." 

35. do execution on] Occurs again 



twice in Titus Andronicus, which is the 
earliest use in New Eng. Diet. (1589). 
I find it in Golding's Ovid (viii. 686, 
687), 1565-7: "his mothers giltie hand 
had . . . Done execution on hirselfe." 
And in Grafton's Continuation of Har- 
^Vt/r (p. 557). 1543 : " Then did he exe- 
cution of suche rebellions [rebels] as 
were taken." 

36. France, thou shalt rue] So in 
King John, in. i. 323 : " France, thou 
shalt rue." 

39. unawares] by surprise. Occurs 
again (three times) in 3 Henry VI. of 
an attack, military exploit. In Golding's 
Ovid (Epistle, 11. 556, 557) :— 

" That whyle I thus stand gazing on 
his [panther's] hyde. 
He may devour mee unbewares " ; 
and bk. iii. 1. 452: "by stealth and un- 
bewares." Elsewhere in Shakespeare, 
except 3 Henry VI. iv. viii. 63, the 
word is preceded by " at." See note, 
Part HI. IV. ii. 23. Elsewhere in Gold- 
ing and in Spenser the word used is " un- 
wares." Peele has "at unawares" 
[Alcazar, iv. ii.).

direction is frequent in these plays : see 
Part II. V. ii. "Excursions" is not a 
word in the text of Shakespeare. As a 
stage direction it is in Vee.\€s David and 
Bethsabe (473, a): "Alarum, excursions, 
assault." And in Marlowe's Edward 
the Second (205, a) : " Alarums, excur- 
sions." In Sclimus only "Alarum" 
occurs. In Greene's Alphonsus it is 
"strike up alarum." 

44. darnel] See again King Lear, iv. iv. 
5, and Henry V. v. ii. 45. See note at 
" cockle, " Love's Labour's Lost, iv. iii. 
380 (Arden edition, p. 107). Used in- 
discriminately with " cockle " for any 
injurious weed in common, but properly 
Lolium. See Turner, Names of Herbes, 
1548 (Eng. Diet. Soc. 1881). " To sowe 
upon the good siede, the pestilent 
Dertiell " (W. Watreman, Fardle of 
Faeions (reprint, Hakluyt, v. 67, 1812), 
1555)- Steevens finds an allusion to 
the poisonous properties of Lolium, 
quoting Gerard: "Darnel hurteth the 
eyes, and maketh them dim, if it happen 
either in corne for breade or drinke." 
He goes on : " Pucelle means to in- 
timate that the corn she carried had 
produced the same effect on the guards 
of Rouen ; otherwise they would have 
seen through her disguise." This seems 
to be very nice, but too far-fetched. 
Only " bad grain " is needful. Is 
Steevens' quotation correct ? 

50. grey-beard] old man. Occurs 
again Tamingof Shrew {iwict:), yulius 
CcEsar, and 3 Henry VI. North's 
Plutarch (1580) is in New Eng. Diet. 
preceding Shakespeare. Greene uses 
it in Selimus (Grosart, xiv. 246, 1. 1333). 



chair?] Pope; three lines Ff, ending gray-beard. Death, 



51. run a tilt at] The expression " run 
a tilt " occurs only in H Henry VL i. iii. 
54 again in Shakespeare : where it 
comes from The Contention, sc. iii. 
It was more usual to make a verb of 
tilt. It is in Marlowe, Edward the 
Second (Dyce, 220, a) : — 

" Tell Isabel the queen, I looked not 
thus 
When for her sake I ran at tilt in 

France 
And there unhorsed the Duke of 
Cleremont." 
It is an expression of Greene's : " What 
causeth men to just, tourney, runne at 
tilt, & combat, but love ? " {Debate 
between Follie and Love, Grosart, iv. 
212,213). And in Eupli lies his Censure 
to Philautus (vi. 184) : " hunting, hawk- 
ing, running at tilt, and other pas- 
times " (1587). 

52. Foul fend] An expressly Shake- 
spearian phrase, occurring a dozen times 
in King Lear, 111. iv., and once in 
Richard IIL i. iv. 58. New Eng. Diet. 
has no example earlier than King Lear, 
There is a tang of the early mysteries 
about "foul fend." Compare Ne7v Cus- 
tom (Hazlitt's Dodsley, iii. 23), ante 
1573 '■ " The foul fetid of hell fetch me, 
body and soul." 

52. hag] witch. New Eng. Diet. 
gives " That hatefull hellish hagge of 
ugly hue " {Mirrour for Magistrates, 
1587). And see Spenser, Faerie Queene, 
I. viii. 46. Shakespeare has this word 
about a dozen times, always of a witch, 
except in King Lear, 11. iv. 281. 

52. despite] malice, mischief, spite. 
Very frequent in Shakespeare.

And twit with cowardice a man half dead ? 55 

Damsel, I '11 have a bout with you again, 

Or else let Talbot perish with this shame. 
Puc. Are ye so hot, sir ? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace ; 

If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow. 

[ The English whisper together in council. 

God speed the parliament ! who shall be the speaker? 60 
Tal. Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field ?

Tal. I speak not to that railing Hecate, 

But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest ; 65 

Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out ? 
Alen. Signior, no. 

59. The English . . .] They . . . Ff. 



55. twit with] Occurs again in Two 
Gentlemen of Verona, iv. ii. 8, 3 Henry 
VI. V. V. 40, and 2 Henry VI. in. i. 
178, but not in Shakespeare s mature 
work. A favourite expression with 
Greene: "Shee twits thee with Vesta 
when God wotte Venus is the goddesse 
that heareth hir orisons" (Tullies Love 
(Grosart, vii. 167), 1589) ; and in A 
Looking Glassefor London (xiv. 12) : — 
" Darst thou check 
Or twit him with the laws that 
nature lowes ? " 
and again, p. 28, 1. 534: "And dar'st 
thou twit me with a womans fault." 
Peele has the exact words in The Tale 
of Troy (556, b), 1589 : " And twits 
Ulysses with his cowardice." 

55. half dead] Compare (Peele's) jfack 
Straw : " Men half-dead, who lie killed 
in conceit" (Hazlitt's Dodsley, v. 408). 

56. have a bout with you] See above, 
I. V. 4, note. 

58. Are ye so hot !>] Occurs again in 
Romeo and Juliet, 11. v. 64, and else- 
where. "Hot," meaning hot-tempered, 
cross, is frequent in Shakespeare. 

59. thunder, rain will follow] "After 
thunder comes a rain " is an old saw. 
It is in Udall's Erasmus' Apophthcgmcs, 
1542 (Robert's. reprint, p. 26), in con- 
nection with Socrates and Xantippe; 
and in The Schole-house of Women 
(Hazlitt's Early Pop. Poetry, iv. 121), 
ante 1570. 

62. Belike] Shakespeare starts sen- 
tences about twenty times with belike, 
very often, as here, in mocking passages. 



64. Hecate] Here a trisyllable, but in 
Midsummer Night's Dreatn and Mac- 
beth (thrice) it is dissyllabic. But we 
have had already some obvious hints 
that Shakespeare was familiar with 
Golding'sOz-'frf,and Golding has it both 
ways. For Golding before, see line 35, 
"do execution on" (note), and "enter- 
talk with," III. i. 63. These are the 
more conspicuous echoes in this Act. 
Golding spells Hecate as Hecat 
three times (Moring's reprint, p. 122, 1. 
174; p. 141, 1. 237; p. 143, 1. 316). 

And at p. 139, 11. 105, 106 : — 

"To Persey's daughter Hecate (of 
whome the witches holde) 
As of their Goddesse " ; 
and at p. 142, 1. 261: "And thou three 
headed Hecate who knowest best the 
way," we have the trisyllable. At p. 139, 
1. 136, he gives it trisyllabic value with- 
out dropping the final e. These are trom 
books vi. and vii. of the Metamor- 
phoses. Greene would have written 
thus : " And Hell and Hecate shall laile 
the Frier" [Frier Bacon, xVu. 22, 1. 378). 
Hecate is in Faerie Queene, i. i. 43. 

66. fight it out] has occurred already, 
I. i. 99 and i. ii. 128. And see 3 Henry 
VI. I. i. 117 and i. iv. 10. Peculiar to 
these plays in Shakespeare. Ne7v Eng. 
Diet, gives an example from VV. Patten 
(1548), in Arber's English Garner, iii. 
109. Peele has it in The Arraignment 
of Paris (Dyce, 358, a), 1584: " To be 
renown'd for happy victory, to fight 
it out." "Test it out" occurs also in 
Peele. 

67. Signior, no] An old piece of chaff, 
founded on " Signior Nobody " perhaps.

Great Cordelion's heart was buried. 

So sure I swear to get the town or die. 
Bur. My vows are equal partners with thy vows. 85 

Tal. But ere we go, regard this dying prince. 



73. came] F i ; come sir Ff 2, 3, 4. 



The remark is jerked in very unex- 
pectedly, supposing there to be no 
further meaning than the mere negative. 
Another form, probably the repartee, is 
" Signior, si," varied to " Signior see " 
sometimes. See (for " Signior No") The 
Noble Souldier [BuUen's Old Plays, i. 
325) and Bullen's note. "Signior No- 
body" occurs in Day, Isle of Gulls 
(noted in Bullen's edition). See too 
the old play Nobody and Somebody in 
Simpson's School of Shakespeare and 
notes. Compare Armin, Tu)o Maids of 
Moreclacke {ante i6o9),(Grosart, p. iii) : 
" Signior No, you're Jocksome." And 
Lyly, Mother Bombie .- " I faith sir, no " 
(Fairholt ed. p. 96, and again p. 124) ; 
and Ben Jonson, Case is Altered {Cun- 
nxn^hdiTn'sGifford, p. 549, b): "Vatturn? 
upon the toe ! Fin. O Signior, no." 
" Signior Si " occurs in Greene's He and 
She Coney catcher (Grosart, x. 224). 
The appellation Signior, dragged in 
here, does not occur again in the trilogy. 
It is found in the Orient and elsewhere. 
"Faith sir no " occurs in Greene's yawK-i 
the Fourth (xiii. 315), and "In faith sir, 
no" in Alphonsus (xiii. 355). 

68. muleters] muleteers, mule-drivers. 
See Antony and Cleopatra, iii. vii. 36. 
Compare pioner, engifier, the recog- 
nised forms. From the French : "Mule- 



tier. A Mulletar, Moyle-keeper, Moyle- 
dri ver ' ' (Cotgrave) . Peele has the word 
in the Battle of Alcazar, iv. i. : 
" Drudges, negroes, slaves and mule- 
ters." 

78. Prtc^'cfow] goaded, invited. Fre- 
quent in Shakespeare. 

82, 83. in this late-betrayed town 
Great Cordelion's heart was buried] 
" Within three dayes after the king was 
hurt, he dyed that is to say the IX. day 
Aprill, and was buryed as he himselfe 
willed at Fount Ebrard or Everard at 
the Feete of his father. Howbeit his 
hart was buryed at Roan and his bow- 
elles in Poytiers" (Grafton, i. 230). 

82. late-betrayed] Compare " late- 
despised Richard," above, 11. v. 36; and 
^'late-deceased," in. ii. 132 below; and 
in Titus Andronicus, i. i. 184. Shake- 
speare has this construction again in 
Venus and Adonis,^i^, "/a<<;-embarked.' 
In 1 Henry IV. 11. iii. 62, '' late-d\s- 
turbed." In Lucrecc, 1740, "late- 
sacked." In every case late is to be 
regarded adverbially, and the hyphen 
is open to objection. " Our /a<f -con- 
firmed league" occurs in The Spanish 
Tragedy. And " East India and the late- 
discover'd isles" in Tamburlaine, Part 
I. I. i. Spenser has " his /a/c-renewed 
might" in Faeri* Queene, i. xi. 35.

8g. crazy] decrepit. Not elsewhere 
in Shakespeare. ''Crazed" was the com- 
mon form at this time. New Eng. Diet. 
has an earher example than the present 
from Fleming (1576). Greene uses it in 
Mamillia (Grosart, ii. 181), 1583 : " Tra- 
vellers . . . which take their iourney, 
either that their credite at home is crasie, 
or else being wedded to vanitie seeke to 
augment their follie." Spenser speaks 
of " craesie " pipes in Colin Clout's 
come Home again, i5gi. 

g4. from hence] So in Marlowe, Tam- 
biirlaine, Part' II. i. 2: " Depart yVo?;t 
hence with me." And in Golding's 
Ovid : " We haled d^r&from hence." 

g5. That stout Pendragon in his litter] 
From John Harding, according to 
Speed's Historic, p. 26g,ed. 1632 : " This 
field was at Verolam, whither Vter [Pen- 
dragon] sicke, and in his Horse-litter, 
was borne among his Army, and after 
long and sore siege, wonne from them 
that Citie." This is Geoffrey of Mon- 
mouth's version. Holinshed attributes 
this heroic deed to Pendragon's brother, 
Aurelius Ambrosius. See too Malory, 
Morte d' Arthur, i. 4, where Merlin com- 
mands Uther Pendragon (King Arthur's 
father) " to the field, though ye ride on 
a horse litter." Grafton tells of Se- 
ward, ruler of Northumberland (who 



died of a flux), in similar fashion to 
Bedford : " When he sawe well that he 
should dye, he caused his armour to be 
put upon him, and so armed and sitting 
in a Chayre, sayde, thus it becommeth 
a knight . . . and not lying in his bed " 
(i. 147). Peele has a similar device in 
the Battle 0/ Alcazar when Abdelmelec 
dies in battle : — 

"as he died, 
My noble brother will we here ad- 
vance. 
And set him in his chair with cun- 
ning props, 
That our IBarbarians may behold 
their king " 
(438, a). 

gg. Undaunted spirit] See above, i. i. 
127, and note at v. v. 70. 

102. gather we] See note at "Em- 
brace we then," 11. i. 13, above. And 
below. III. iii. 68. 

102. out of hand] Occurs as here 
(meaning at once, directly) again in 
Titus Andronicus, v. ii. 77, and in 3 
Henry VI. iv. vii. 63. In ^ Henry IV. 
III. i. 107, the meaning is off one's hands, 
done with. A common expression, 
found twice in Golding's Ovid, and in 
the second part of Whetstone's Promos 
and Cassandra.

" Nature's sole wonder in whose 
beauteous breasts 
All heavenly grace and virtue was 
enslirined " 
(v. iv.). 

122. familiar^ attendant spirit. For 
" Pucelle," see note, i. ii. 50. We get 
the English viewofher in this Act. See 
Love's Labour's Lost, i. ii. 162 (note, 
Arden ed. p. 27). 

123. braves'\ expressions of defiance, 
brags, boasts. A very common word in 
Greene's prose and plays. As in Frier 
Bacon (1. 1921), "such shamelesse braves 
as manhood cannot brooke." 

123. gleeks] scoffs. See Romeo and 
Juliet, IV. V. 115. And Greene's Far£- 
well to Follie (Gvoi^cLit, ix.251) : "Among 
the rest mcssieur Benedetto galled 
Peratio with this gleeke." Both these 
terms occur commonly at the time. 

124. all amort] very downcast. Oc- 
curs again in Taming of the Shrew, iv. 
iii. 36. Greene has it twice, as in Frier 
Bacon (1. 28, Grosart, xiii. S) : "Shall 
he thus all amort live malecontent ? " 
And in The Thirde Part of Conny- 
Catching (x. 171): " Blancke and all 
amort sits the poore Cutler, and with 
such a pittifull countenaunce." New 
Eng. Diet, has no earlier examples, but 
it occurs in Whetstone's Promos and 



Ca55a«rfrrt, Part I. (1575), as I have shown 
in Appendix II. \.o Measure for Measure 
(Arden ed. p. 153). See too Peele's 
Edward I. (Dyce, 392, a) : " What, all 
amort I How doth my dainty Nell ? " 

126. take some order] make arrange- 
ments. A favourite expression of Shake- 
speare's. New Eng. Diet, quotes from 
Grafton's Chronicle, i. 176, 1568: "When 
the king had thus taken order with his 
affayres in Denmarke, he returned 
shortly into England " (not the reference 
for the reprint). See Peele, Edward I. 
(Dyce, 397, b) :— 

" He is thine own, as true as he is 
mine; 
Take order, then, that he be passing 
fine." 

127. expert] experienced, skilled, as 
in Henry V. iii. vii. 139. For placing, 
see note at i. i. 132. In Tamburlaine, 
Part II. Act I. Marlowe has: "A 
hundred thousand expert soldiers.' ' See 
Faerie Queene, i. ix. 4 : "In warlike 
feates th' expertest man alive." 

132. late-di'ccas'd] Again in Titus 
Andronicns, i. i. 184. As the Uuke of 
Bedford has barely died at this point, 
the expression perhaps implies some of 
the natural confusion in the mind of 
the writer of the secjuence of events. 
See note at "late-betrayed," above, ni. 
ii. 82. 

132, 133. Duke of Bedford . . . exe- 
quies] There is this much truth in this 
unhistorical scene, that the Duke of 
Bedford kept his Norman court and 
parliament at Roan : " the xiiij day of 
September, died lohn Duke of Bedford 
Regent of Fraunce, a man as politique in

But see his exequies fulfill'd in Roan.

SCENE III. — The Saiue. The Plains near Rouen. 

Enter CHARLES, the Bastard of ORLEANS, ALENfON, La 
PUCELLE, and forces. 

Puc. Dismay not, princes, at this accident, 
Nor grieve that Roan is so recovered :

For things that are not to be remedied.

peace, as hardy in warre, whose bodie 
was with great funerall solempnitie 
buried in the Cathedrall Church of our 
Lady in Roan, on the North side of the 
high Aulter, under a sumptuous and 
costly monument" (Grafton, i. 605, The 
XIII J Yere). 

133. exequies] funeral rites. Not 
again in Shakespeare. In Wyclif, 2 
Samuel iii. 31 (1382). And in Ben 
Jonson, Sad Shepherd, i. ii. Elsewhere 
in I Shakespeare it is " obsequies." In 
Grafton, i. 308 : " his father was buryed, 
and the Exequies scantly finished." 
See Locrine (last speech). 

134. couched lance] laid, or levelled 
for attack, by lowering the point. 
" Couched spear " occurs in Malory's 
Morte d' Arthur, i. xi. (1480), New Eng. 
Diet. Not in Shakespeare again. For 
the structure of these two lines, see 
Part II. I. i. 15, 16 (note). "Couched 
his spear" is often in Faerie Queene. 

136. mightiest potentates] ''Potentate" 
is only in Shakespeare's earliest plays 
(Love' s Labour's Lost 2.nA Two Gentle- 
men 0/ Verona). " Mighty potentate " is 
an expression of Greene's in several 
places, asEuphues to Philautus (vi. 177) : 
" to be loved of such a. mighty Potentate.'" 
''Potentate" is very common in Greene. 

137. This weak-ending wretched line 
is of a sort that abounds in Greene. 
Misery, prophecy, certainty, injury, 
speedily, company, destiny, ebony, 
penalty, presently, majesty, heresy, 
courtesy, victory, comedy, all end lines 
in Alphonsns — to say nothing of packed 



monosyllables. And similarly in Or- 
lando. See above, 11. i. 43. 

Scene hi. 

I. Dismay not] do not be frightened. 
The intransitive verb is not found 
again in Shakespeare. Compare 
Stephen Hawes, Pastime of Pleasure, 
xxxiv. 5, 1509 (Percy reprint, p. 171) : — 
"Be of goodchere, and for nothyng 
dismaye, 
I spake with her but now this other 
daye." 
Neui Eng. Diet, has another earlier ex- 
ample. Spenser has it in Faerie Queene, 

3. Care is no cure] grief, sorrow, is the 
meaning of "care" here, as in "past 
cure, past care" (Love's Labour's Lost, 
V. ii. 28). Ray and Fuller (Gtwmologia, 
1732) adopt this as a proverb. 

3. corrosive] fretting, giving pain. 
The noun occurs in ^ Henry VL iii. ii. 
403. Neither of them appears again in 
Shakespeare, in which he is peculiar, as 
they were very popular with the drama- 
tists in the forms corsie, corsive, cor- 
rosive, etc. An " inward corsie," or " a 
corsie to the heart," occurs three times 
in Golding's Ovtd (1567). Greene has 
the noun "corasive" several times in 
Mamillia: "the corasive of despair " 
(p. 152), " a corasive to renew thy griefe " 
(p. 171), etc. Compare Gascoigne, The 
Steele Glas (Arber, p. 43), 1576: "The 
corrosyve of caxe woukle quickely con- 
founde me." And Spenser, Faerie 
Queene, i. x. 25 and iv. ix. 14 (" bitter 
corsive").

6, 7. peacock . . . plumes] Occurs 
twice in Whetstone, Promos and Cas- 
sandra, 1575 ; and many times in 
Greene's prose works, generally with 
reference to the ugly feet. These lines 
read like Greene — slightly altered. 

7. pull his plumes] Craig {Little 
Quarto) refers to Greene, George-a- 
Greette (Dyce, 261, b) : " What shall 
he? George. Pull all your plumes 3.nd 
sore dishonour you." Greene has it 
again in his Metamorphosis (Grosart, ix. 
22) : " I was, Sonne . . . once young 
and buxsome . . . where now a tawny 
hiew pulleth downe my plumes.'' And 
in his Farewell to Follie (ix. 260) : 
" Cresus was proude of his pelfe, but 
Solon pulde downe his plumes." And no 
doubt it occurs elsewhere in Greene. 
But all these are later than Tambur- 
laine, Part I.i. i. : " Tamburlaine, That 
... as I heare doth mean to pull my 
plumes." 

7. train] tail, particularly a fine one. 
Davies has "thy gay peacocks traine" 
in The Immortality of the Soul, xxxiv. 
viii. (1592). And in the old Taming of 
a Shrew [Six Old Plays, p. 203) : 
" Bewteous and stately as the eie- 
trained bird" occurs. 

10. of thy cu?ining had no diffidence] 
of thy magic cleverness had no distrust. 
See King John, i. i. 65, for " diffidence " 
again. And for " cunning," see 11. i. 50. 

11. foil] "defeat, miscarriage" 
(Schmidt). See again, v. iii. 23, the 
only parallel in Shakespeare : " give the 
French the foil." It is a phrase met 
elsewhere in Greene: " Shal I loue so 
lightly? shal Fancie give me the foyle 
at the first dash ? " {Mamillia (ii. 73)). 
Greene repeats these words later in his 



Metamorphoses (ix. 59). In Frier Bacon 
(xiii. 61, 1. 1301) Greene has "take 
not now the foile." Earlier examples 
are given in New Eng. Diet. Marlowe 
has " And never had the Turkish em- 
peror So great a foil by any foreign 
iot" {Tamburlaine, Part I., end of Act 
iii.). 

12. policies] stratagems, schemes, 
dodges, tricks. The most unmistak- 
able example of this meaning, since the 
only plural one. Elsewhere (as glossed 
by Schmidt) it may mean much what it 
does now — plan of action. It is a 
favourite word, in a bad sense, with 
Greene in his Conny-Catching tracts : 
" They will straight spotte him by sundry 
pollicies, and in a black horse, marke 
saddle-spots," etc. {Second Pari of 
Conny-Catching, x. 77). And in A 
Looking Glasse for London (xiv. 82) : 
" I have a pollicie to shift him, for I 
know he comes out of a bote place," etc. 
In George-a-Greene (xiv. 146, 1. 551) 
this very expression occurs: " But now 
He flie to secret policie." 

18. sugar'd words] See again, 2 Henry 
VI. in. ii. 45 (note), and Richard III. 
HI. i. 13. "In the days when sugar of 
any kind was a rarity, and consequently 
a delicacy, our English poets used the 
word [sugar] with a certain appetite 
in their comparisons." — Note to a trans- 
lation of Persian poetry by Sir Richard 
Burton, in his Life, 1893, ii. 68. In 
Persian it still holds its ground. It is 
a standard phrase with Greene : " they 
seeke with sugred words and filed speech 
to inveigle the sillie eyes of wel meaning 
Gentlewomen" {Mamillia (Grosart, ii. 
258), 1583). And again : "Love commeth 
in ... by seeing natures workes not

by hearing sugred wordes" (p. 283). 
And often elsewhere. He has " sugred 
speech" in Tritameron (1584), etc., etc. 
Spenser has " stigred words and gentle 
blandishment" (Fcurie Quccne, iii. vi. 

25)- 

19, 20. We will entice the Duke . . . 
to follow «s] There is this much his- 
torical accuracy here, that it was in the 
year of Bedford's death that Burgundy 
deserted the English for the French 
king. Grafton says (p. 604) : '' He 
therefore imagined, and determined with 
himselfe to returne into the pathe againe, 
from the which he had strayed and 
erred, and to take part and ioyne with 
his awne bloud and Nation : so that 
some honest meane might be sought 
by other, and not by himselfe, least . . . 
he might be noted of vntruth and traytor- 
ous behaviour toward the King of Eng- 
land and his nation : to whom he had 
done homage, league, and sworne fealtie. 
Now this counsayle [of Arras] was to 
him a cloke for the rayne, as who should 
say, that he sought not amitie of the 
french king (which thing in his hert 
most coveted and desyred) but was there- 
unto persuaded by the generall coun- 
sayle, and by the Bishop of Rome." 
There is here no mention of Joan's 
influence ; she is the dramatist's own 
introduction for "the honest meane he 
sought for" as a cloak for the rain, or 
the excuse he sought for. But Rolfe 
transcribes a letter of Joan's to the Duke 
of Burgundy (published by Barante, 
Histoire des Dues de Bourgogne, iv. 259), 
of date 1429, " using arguments not at 
all unlike those of this scene." The 
original is at Lille. Rolfe thinks the 
author of this play must have had access 



to some French chronicler by whom 
the substance of the letter was given. 
The letter is too long to transcribe 
and I do not find it the least con- 
vincing. 

21. sweeting] See Othello, 11. iii. 257 
(note, Arden edition, p. in). A favour- 
ite word with Greene : " Tell me faire 
sweeti)ig, wants, thou any thing Conteind 
within the threefold circle of the world? " 
{A Looking Glasse, Grosart, xiv. 45). 
And again, p. 13 : " so bright a sweetings 
armes" ; and again (p. 10) in the same 
play ; and elsewhere in his prose. 
Shakespeare has it several times. 

24. extirped] extirpates. Occurs again 
in Measure for Measure, in. ii. no : see 
note, Arden edition. Occurs in Hall's 
Chronicle, and in the Faerie Queene, i. 
X. 25. 

25. expuls'd] expelled. Not unfre- 
quently used in this century (i6th), but 
not again in Shakespeare. Nashe uses 
it of academic rustication : " touching 
his whole persecution by the Fellowes 
of the House about it, and how, except 
he had mercie on him, he were expulst " 
[Have with you, etc., Grosart, iii. ng). 
And Gascoigne, The Steele Glas, 1576 
(Arber, p. 43): " Themistocles ... by 
his unkinde citizens of Athens expulsed 
from his owne." The word occurs 
several times in Golding's Ovid's Meta- 
morphoses. 

28. bring . . . to the wished end] 
Compare Locrine, 11. i. (Peele and 
Greene ?) : " And bring our wished joys 
to perfect end." See note at Part H. 
III. ii. 113. ■' Wished day " and " wished 
haven " both occur in Faerie Queene, 11. 
(i. 32 and iv. 22).

by a stain. See Schmidt on this word 
(141S, a). Compare Lucrece, 1059, 
1316. 

60. exclaims on thee] Compare Kyd's 
Spanish Tragedy, in. xiv. 70: — 

"what a scandale wert among 
the kings 
To heare Hieronymo exclaim on 
thee ? " 
Often with " upon." 

61. progeny] descent. Compare 
Greene, Planetomachia (v. 40) : " the 
destinies have appoynted my progenie 
from such a peevish Parent " ; and 
Menaphon (vi. no): "My parents and 
progenie are envied by obscuritie " ; and 
A Princely Mirrour of Peereless Modestie 
(iii. 9) : " Honored generallie of all men 
for his parentage and progenie " ; and 
passim in Greene, meaning parentage, 
but not so used by Shakespeare. Bur- 
gundy's original reason for allying him- 
self with the English was : " Beyng 
much desjTous to reuenge and punishe 
the shameful! murther done to his father " 
(Grafton, 604). Grafton illustrates" pro- 
geny " (i. 306) : "This Erie was of the 
bloud royall . . . To whome the king 
not respecting his bloud and progeny 
sayde . . . then is it meetethathe . . . 
should hang higher then any of the 
other." 



64. set footing] Occurs again Richard 
II. 11. ii. 48; '^ Henry VI. ni. ii. 87; 
Henry VIII. in. i. 183. 

66. 67. Who then but . . . fugitive] 
This was Burgundy's chief reason with 
himself, according to the Chronicler : 
" For he in the beginning of his rule . . . 
beganne to be associate, and to reigne 
with the English power, and to serve the 
King of England, thinking that by his 
amitie and ioyning, he shoulde neither 
harme nor hurte the common wealth of 
the County, whereof at that time he 
bore the whole rule, nor yet lose one 
iote or point of his aucthoritie or govern- 
aunce. But when it happened contrary 
to his expectation, that the King of 
Englande . . . tooke upon him the 
whole rule . . . and that he was not 
had ... in a perfite trust," etc. (p. 
604). 

67. fugitive] a runaway to the other 
party. Very bad sense, see Marlowe, 
Tamburlaine,V2LXt II. in. v.: "Villain, 
traitor, da.mntd fugitive " (Tamburlaine 
to Almeyda). 

68. Call 7fe] See above, n. i. 13, and 
in. ii. 102. 

68-73. Call we to mind . , . friends] 
This narration is jumbled history, and 
the passage stating the real facts will be 
found in Grafton, i. 618, 619 (or Hall, 
192, 193). But it is lengthy and intri- 
cate, and need not be more than referred

here : " The duke was not Hberated till 
after Burgundy's decline to the French 
interest ; which did not happen, by the 
way, till some years after the execution 
of this very Joan la Pucelle : nor was 
that during the regency of York, but 
of Bedford." This blundering "over- 
tedious " stuff reminds me all the time 
of Greene. The repeated words " Come, 
come, return : return " (1. 76) are his, as 
in 11. 50, 53 above, and 44. 

75, join'st] This rugged monosyllable 
occurs above, 1.62. Peele is given tothis. 
In Edward I. he uses pay'st, see'st, 
dart'st, may'st, etc. See " fight'st " 
above, 1. 74 ; and in 2 Henry VI. And 
"fail'st," 3 Henry VI. 11. i. 190. 

75. slaughter-men] See again, 3 
Henry VI. i. iv. 169, and Titus An- 
dronicus, iv. iv. 58. Also in Cymbeline 
and Henry V. It occurs in Greene's 
Groats Worth of Wit (xii. 142) : " Onely 
Tyrants should possesse the earth, and 
they striuing to exceede in tyranny, 
should each to other bee a slaughter 
man : till the mightiest out-liuing all, 
one stroke were left for Death." The 
word is found (later) in Arden of 
Feversham. 

76. Come, come . . . wand' ring lord] 
See note at 1. 72. " Haughty " in the next 
line is characteristic of Greene, but not 
a very common word earlier and found 
in Shakespeare only in his earliest work. 
It occurs five times in this play. See 



next note. Craig says Shakespeare 
never uses " haughty " in a good sense. 

78. haughty words] So Greene, 
George-a-Greene (xiv. 132) : " Nick, as 
you know, is hautie in his wordes " ; 
and Orlando Furioso : " Haw tie theii 
words" (xiii. 170). 

79. roaring cannon-shot] " Cannon- 
shot " does not occur in Shakespeare,

ScEXE /.] Grafton gives the list of 
those present : " There were in his 
company of his awne Nation, his 
Vncle the Cardinal! of Winchester, the 
Cardinall and Archebyshop ofYorke, the 
Dukes of Bedford, Yorke, and Norfolke, 
the Earles of VVarwike, Sahsburie, 
Oxford, Huntyngdon, Ormonde, Mor- 
tayn, Suftoike, and of Gascoynes . . . 
he was met at the Chapell, in the meane 
way, by Syr Simon Moruer Provost of 
Paris, with a great company " (The 
X Yere, 143 1, p. 591). Boswell Stone 
says (p. 228) : " Gloucester was in Eng- 
land . . . Lieutenant of England during 
the King's absence." "Somerset" was 
Edmund Beaufort, then Earlof Mortain; 
Talbot was a prisoner in 1431 ; Exeter 
(Thomas Beaufort) died about five years 
before; the Fsench Governor of Paris 
is a fictitious personage (the last re- 
mark may be set aside). Grafton tells 
us that after " divers riche and notable 
burgesses " had done their reverence 
"there approched to the king the IX. 
worthies, sytting richely on horseback, 
armed with the armes to them apper- 
teyning." . . . " And on the xvij of the 



sayde Moneth [December] he departed 
from the Palace in great triumph, 
honorably accompanyed to our Lady 
Church of Paris : where with all solemp- 
nitie he was annoynted and crowned 
King of Fraunce by the Cardinall of 
Winchester: (the Byshop of Paris not 
being content that the Cardinall should 
doe such a high ceremonie in his 
Church and jurisdiction)." The men- 
tion of the Nine Worthies is interesting. 
At about the time this play passed 
through Shakespeare's hands, he was 
introducing them into Love's Labour's 
Lost. 

6. pretend] aim at, mean, intend. 
See Two Gentlemen, u. vi. 37, and Mac- 
beth, II. iv. 24. 

7. practices] stratagems. 

8. Sir John Fastolfe] See note at i. 
i. 116. The note there gives the name 
Patay, Capell's correction for Poictiers, 
which was fought a century before this 
date (line 19). It was the Duke of 
Bedford who " in a great anger toke 
from hym the Image of Saint George 
and the Garter." They were restored 
again against Talbot's wishes.

that it was founded " to adorne Marliall 
vertue with honours, rewards and

In a good sense here. See note at 111. 
iii. 76. 77- 

36. crt'dit] honourable reputation. 

3S. most extrinies] the greatest ex- 
tremes, or extremities, dangers, straits. 
" Most '' is very commonly used without 
the article by Shakespeare. " Ex- 
tremes " in this sense occurs in several 
of Shakespeare's plays. Compare Gold- 
ing's Ovid, ix. 354 : " my most fo." And 
Peele, Sir Clyomon (527, a, Routledge) : 
" My most misfortunes." 

43. hedge-born] born or brought up 
under a hedge ; contemptuously used. 
Boorish, low, common. Compare 
"hedge-priest," Love's Labour's Lost, 
V. ii. 536, and note Arden edition. And 
see 2 Henry VL iv. ii. 55. There were 
many such compounds, amply collected 
in New Eng. Diet. For the latter 
member, compare base-born, true-born, 
etc. in these plays. 

43. swain] Shakespeare was ex- 
tremely partial to this word. Spenser 
uses it in two senses, youth and servant. 
In the text here it is a term of con- 
tempt. See note in Todd's Spenser 
(Faerie Queene, i. viii. 13). 

44. gentle blood] Only again (in this 
sense) in ''gentler blood" (below, v. iv. 
8) in Shakespeare. In ancient use, 
occurring in Cursor Mundi [ante 1300) 
(Nezv Eng. Diet.). And Faerie Queene, 
II. iv. I : " But chiefly skill to ride 



seemes a science Proper to gentle 
blood." 

46. Be packing] away with you. 
Frequent in Shakespeare. 

48. the letter] Grafton narrates this 
episode: "when thys league was sworne, 
and this knot knit, the Dukeof Burgoyne 
. . . sent Thoison Dor, his king at 
armes to King Henry with letters: that 
he being not only waxed faint and

That an>- one should therefore be suspicious

162, 163. Cousin of York . . . our 
regent in these parts of France] " After 
the death of . . . the Duke of Bedford 
. . . the Englishe people . . . set up a 
new sayle, and beganne thewarre newe 
agayne, and appointed for Regent in 
Fraunce, Richard Duke of Yorke . . . 
althoughe the Duke of Yorke, both for 
birth and courage, was worthy of this 
honour and preferment, yet he was so 
disdayned of Edmonde Duke of Somer- 
set, beyng Cosyn to the king, that he 
was promoted to so high an office (which 
he in very deede gaped and looked for) 
that by all wayes and meanes possible, 
he both hindered and detracted him, 
glad of his losse, and sorie of his well 
doing ; causing him to linger in England 
without dispatch, till Parys and the 
Flower of Fraunce were gotten by the 
French king. The Duke of Yorke per- 
ceyving his euiilwill, openly dissimuled 
that which he inwardly thought, eche 
working things to the others displeasure. 
This cancared malice and pestiferous 
diuision so long continued in the hartes 
of these two Princes, till mortall warre 
consumed them both, and almost all 
their lines and ofsprings, as within fewe 
yeres you shall perceyue " (The XIII J 
Yere (p. 606), 1435). Bosweil Stone 
omits this obviously needed passage 
(from Hall and Grafton) ; he proceeds 
here to consider "good my lord of 
Somerset, unite . . . your horsemen 



. . . with his foot " (164, 165), and finds 
historical warrant in 1443 for the joined 
forces in the following passage, in Graf- 
ton (The XIX Yere (1440, not 1443), p. 
619): "The Dukes of YorkeandSommer- 
set, lykewise entered into the Duchie of 
Aniow, and Countie of Mayne, destroi- 
3'ng townes, spoilyng the people, and 
with great pray and profile, repayred 
again into Normandie." This is quite 
a needless and confusing excursion to 
mention here. Nothing in the play 
arises out of Henry's friendly mandate 
to the two rivals. But that it was of 
no effect, Grafton tells us (607) : " Many 
other townes in Fraunce were taken 
and betrayed, for lacke of succours and 
sufficient garrisons, then the Duke of 
Yorke appoynted at the Parliament 
before to be regent of Fraunce, and by 
the disde>Ti and envy of the Duke of 
Sommerset and other, not till now dis- 
patched, was sent into Normandie." 

167. digest] distribute, disperse, dis- 
sipate. The oldest sense of this word, 
often spelt " disgest" at this time, and 
still provinciallv in the North. Compare 
All's Well that Ends Well, v. iii. 74. 
Physical language of the time. Com-

i8g. shouldering] Spenser uses this : — 
" Some thought to raise themselves 
to high degree 
By riches and unrighteous reward : 
Some by close shouldring ; some 
by flatteree " 
(Farric Queene, ii. vii. 47). The passage 
is descriptive of the Court of Ambition. 
And in Colin Clout's Come Home Again, 
speaking of court he says: — 

" Ne is there place for any gentle 
wit . . . 
But shouldred is or out of doore 
quite shit" 
(11. 707-709). And in Faerie Queene, 11.

there the broils would have been bloody.

the Gascon towns, of which the French 
king was determined to get possession. 
Cirafton gives a full account of how, one 
by one, all were lost — all Normandy — 
and especially Bourdeaux, which had 
been English for about three centuries. 
At this time the Duke of York, in order 
to advance privily, without spot of 
usurpation, his title to the crown, 
thought it expedient to pick a quarrel 
with the Duke of Somerset: "which 
ruled the king, ordered the realme and 
most miglit doe with the Queene : 
Whome the commons, for the losse of 
Normandy, worse then a Tode or 
Scorpion hated, disdained and abhorred, 
in so much that diverse evill ruled 
persons, brake his house and spoyled 
his goods " (p. 646). During the factions 
and commotions that ensued (Black 
heath, Brent heath) "came Ambassa- 
dors from the heddes and Magistrates 
of the City of Burdeaux . . . which 
signified to the Counsaile, that if they 
would send an armie into Gascoyn, the 
Gascoynes would revert and turne 
againe to the Englishe part (p. 648). 
. . , The Counsayle of Englande . . . 
appointed the noble souldiour and 
valyaunt Capitayne lohn Lorde Talbot, 
and Erie of Shrewsburie to be Chiefe- 
tayne of the armie which should in all 
haste be transported into Aquitay-ne. 
The Lordes of Gascoyne . . . glad of 
their aunswere . . . exhorting every 
man to be firme ... to the King of 
England and his heyres, under whose 
liberty . . . they had prospered . , .

now to fall into the French captivity: 
whose . . . daylie exactions were to 
them importable . . . The Erie of 
Shrewsburie toke his chaunce . . . his 
army, being scant three thousand men, 
and destroyed all the Countrey between 
Burdeaux and Blay. and toke the strong 
towne and Castell of Fronsac, and divers 
other townes . . . till he came before 



the Citie of Burdeaux. The citizens 
. . . opened one gate and let in a great 
parte of the Englishe armie." 

10, II. three attctuinnd . . . climb- 
ing Jire] See Henry V. Act i. chorus, 
1. 7. From a speech of King Henry 
the Fifth after the siege of Rouen, when 
messengers of surrender come to him 
with a "subtile and crafty invention," 
he said : " If these things be to you blind 
and obscure, I will declare and open 
them to you. The Goddesse of warre 
called Bellona (which is the Correctrice 
of Princes for right withholdyng, or 
injury doyng, and the plague of God for 
evill lyvng) hath these three hand- 
maydes, euer of ncccssitie to attend 
vpon her, that is, blood, fyre and famine 
which three Damoselles be of that force 
and strength that euery of them alone is 
able to torment and afflict a proude 
Prince; But they all beyng iojTied to- 
gether, are of puyssaunce able to destroy 
the most populous Countrie and richest 
region of the worlde. ... I have ap- 
poynted the mekest of the three Damo- 
sels to afflict and plague you, until you 
be brydeled and brought to reason, which 
shall be when it shall please me . . . 
the choyse is in my hande to tame you 
eyther with blood, fyre or famin, or wyth 
all. I will take the choyse at my pleasure 
and not at yours " (Grafton (or Hall), 
The VIJ Yere, Henry the Fift). Ho- 
linshed has this abridged. So Peele in 
Battle of Alcazar, u. iii. : — 

" Crying for battle, famine, sword, 
and fire. 
Rather than calling for relief or 
life " 
(428 a, Routledge). 

11. Lean famine] Shakespeare 
abounds in epithets to personifications. 
See "pale destruction," below, I. 27. 
"Lean" is usually appropriated by 
Envy. See Whitney's Emblems (ed. 
Green, p. 94), 1586: "This Envie is 
leane, pale, and full of yeares."

dyng (452), 1543). 

29. rive their . . . artillery] Ex- 
plained " fire till they split," which is 
not satisfactory. The object is not to 
burst the guns but to hit Talbot. I 
should like to read " rove," an ordinary 
term, meaning to find the elevation or 
aim. See Nares for examples. Used 
by Sir John Harmgton, Spenser, etc. 
And in Greene : " But Bacon roves a 
bow beyond his reach" {Frier Bacon, 
Grosart, xiii. 17). However, no one 
except Shakespeare would have made 
this bold and expressive use of the word 
" rive."

O ! negligent and heedless discipline ; 

34. due\ Theobald ; dew Ff. 
d\ie\ endue, endow. New Eng. Carde of Fancic (GroszTt/iv. 162), is^\ : 



has an example of this verb (in 
this sense) from Piers Plowman. "Dew' 
might be defended as meaning abso- 
lutely to shed tears for, mourn for. 
" Dewing tears " was often used, as in 2 
Henry VI. in. ii. 340. It is twice in 
Greene's A Maidens Dreame, but not so 
violently. 

36. sandy hour] hour measured by 
the sand of the glass. Compare Mer- 
chant of Venice, i. i. 25 : "I should not 
see the sandy hour-glass run." 

38. wither'd] See 3 Henry VI. 11. v. 

I02. 

39. warning bell] Compare Romeo 
and jfuliet, v. iii. 207. Greene has the 
term in A Looking Glasse for London 
(Grosart, xiv. 87, 1. 1981): — 

" Sinne growne to pride, to miser>' is 
thrall. 
The warning bell is rung, beware 
to fall." 

41. departure] death. Not again in 
Shakespeare. New Eng. Diet, quotes 
from a Will, 1558. And from 2 Timothy 
(A.V.), 1611. It is in Kyd's Cornelia, 
III. iii. 85 (Boas ed.) : " Hee that of his 
departure tooke the spoyle " ; and earlier, 
"departure or decease" occurs. 

42. He fables not] The verb is found 
again only in 3 Henry VI. v. v. 25. 
Steevens quotes from Greene's George- 
a-Greene, The Pinner of Wakefield 
(Grosart, xiv. 153): "good father, /a6/^ 
not with him" (the lines are miserable 
stuff). Greene has it again in The 

8 



" Why Gwj'donius (quoth he) wilt thou 
seeke to proue thy selleloyall, when the 
hearers deeme thee a lyar . . . Dost 
thou think my fathers furie wil suffer 
thee to fable ? " 

43. some light horsemen] "light- 
armed cavalry soldiers," acting as 
scouts. New Eng. Diet, quotes from 
Patten, Expedition to Scotland, 1548. 
I find the term in a Letter from the 
Queen to the Bishop of Chester, 1580 
(Nichols' Pro^rfsstfs, ii. 298, ed. :i823): 
" We thinke yt verie convenient and 
needful 1 for oure present service and the 
defence of that our realme [Ireland] to 
have a certaine number of horsemen 
put in readiness to serve as light 
horsemen" ; and again next page. 
Compare VctXc, Battle of Alcazar, iv. 

" Consisting ol light armed horse 
And of the garrisons from Tangier 
brought " 
(p. 435, a). 

43. pertise] examine. In Goiding's 
Ovid, bk. xiv. 11. 312, 313: — 

" And so perusing every herb by good 
advysement, she 
Did wey them out." 
See Richard II. in. iii. 53 and 2 Henry 
IV. IV. ii. 94. 

43. wings] a military term. See 
quotation at " chosen shot," i. iv. 53. 
In All's Well that Ends Well, Cymbeline, 
etc. See quotation from Spanish Tra- 
gedy at 1. 23.

THE FIRST PART OF 



[act IV. 



How are we park'd and bounded in a pale, 45 

A little herd of England's timorous deer, 

Maz'd with a >'clping kennel of French curs ! 

If we be English deer, be then in blood ; 

Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch, 

But rather moody, mad, and desperate stags, 50 

Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel 

And make the cowards stand aloof at bay : 

Sell every man his life as dear as mine. 

And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends. 

God and Saint George, Talbot and England's right, 55 

Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight ! 

l^Exeunt. 

50. moody, mad, and] moodic mad: And Ff i, 2, 3 ; moodie mad and F 4; 
moody-mad and Capell, Cambridge. 56. [Exeunt] omitted F i. 



45. park'd] enclosed, as in a park. 
New Eng. Diet, has several examples 
ranging backwards to beginning of cen- 
tury. " Pale," an enclosure, is frequent 
in Shakespeare. Compare Puttenham, 
Arte of English Poesie (Arber, p. 
112) : — 

" Within the pale of true obeysaunce : 

Holding imparked as it were. 

Her people like to heards of deere." 

Shakespeare often recalls Puttenham. 

See Love 's Labour 's Lost (Introduction, 

Arden ed.). 

47. Maz'd] stupefied, dazed. 

48. in blood] in perfect trim. See 
Love's Labour's Lost, iv. ii. 4, note, 
Arden edition, p. 71. See Coriolanus, 
I. i. 163. Compare Jonson's Sad Shep- 
herd, I. ii. : — 

"A heart of ten . . . good venison, 
According to the season in the 
blood." 
A sportsman's term. 

49. rascal-like] like the worthless deer 
of a herd, with reference to the ordinary 
sense of rascal. See i. ii. 35 (note). 

49. pinch] a snap, or slight bite. 
From the verb used 3 Henry VL 11. i. 
16. A recognised term in the chase ; 
see note at last reference. The verb 
occurs twice in Golding's Ovid. And in 
Spenser's Visions 0/ Petrarch, i. : — 
" Two eager dogs ... so in their 
cruell race 
They pincht the haunches of that 
gentle beast." 



50. moody] sulky, "dangerous." 
Compare Golding's Ovid, vi. 42, 43 : — 
" Hir countnance did bewray 
Hir moodie minde." 
I am quite unable (from some mental 
obliquity) to see the desirability of 
Capell's interjected hyphen here. The 
adjective is a favourite one with Shake- 
speare. 

50. mad] passionate, furious. See 
below, iii. 28. 

52. stand aloof] Occurs several times 
in Shakespeare, who uses "aloof" only 
with " stand " and " keep." " Off aloof " 
occurs below, iv. iv. 21. Compare 
Locrine, i. i. : — 

" I will not stand aloof from off the 
lure, 
Like crafty dames that most of all 

deny 
That which they most desire to 
possess " 
(lines recalling Shakespeare more than 
is often the case). 

54. dear deer] a favourite quibble in 
Shakespeare. See Love 's Labour 's 
Lost, IV. i. 112 (and note, Arden edition). 
Schmidt references it no less than nine 
times. 

55. God and Saint George] See again 
3 Henry VL 11. i. 204, and iv. ii. 29 ; 
Richard IIL v. iii. 270. We may 
safely set this scene, like its predecessor, 
down to Shakespeare. 

55. Talbot and England's right] See 
I. i. 128, note.

mion, III. iii.). Here there is probably a 
thought of the equivalent "vast" as in 
Hamlet, i. ii. 198. Peele affords a good 
example of " waist " meaning girdle : — 
" That so I might have given thee for 
thy pains 
Ten silver shekels and a golden 
waist " 
(Quarto "wast"), David and Bethsabe, 
(481, a). 

21. hemm'd about with . . . destruc- 
tion] Compare Troilusand Cressida, iv. 
V. 195 ; and Venus and Adonis, 229, 
1022. See also Marlowe and Nashe, 
Dido (Grosart, vi. 28), 11. i. : — 

"And after him, his band of Mirmi- 
dons. 
With balles of wilde fire . . . 
All which hemd me about, crying, 
this is he." 
And Tamburlaine, Parti. 11. iv. : "Till 
I may see thee hemm'd with armed 
men." 

25. cornets] bands of cavalry. Peele 
has the word at the beginning of i. ii. 
in Battle of Alcazar : — 

" Pisano, take a cornet of our horse, 
As many argolets and armed pikes. 
And with our carriage march away 
before." 
And in connection with Peele's part 
authorship of Locrine, compare the 
beginning of 11. iv. in that play; — 
" Hubba go take a coronet of our 
horse. 
As many landers and light-armed 

knights 
As may suffice for such an enter- 
prise." 
" Light-armed horse " occurs in Alcaxar, 



near the end. See Introduction. Com- 
pare Kyd's Spa7iish Tragedy, 1. ii. 41 : — 

" Don Pedro their chiefe Horsemens 
Corlonell 
Did with his Cornet bravely make 

attempt 
To breake the order of our battel 1 
rankes." 
See for this further at "squadrons 
pitched," IV. ii. 23. 

29. remiss] negligent, careless. Oc- 
curs half a dozen times in Shakespeare. 

31, 32. He dies, we lose . . .] Words 
set in opposition like these, or grouped 
in heaps of nominatives and verbs and 
accusatives, separated, are met with not 
only in Shakespeare but almost all 
poetical writers of the latter half of the 
century. See Puttenham, Arber reprint, 
p. 242. Upton gives a good note to 
Faerie Queenc (Todd's ed.), i. xi. 28, 
with examples from Fairfax and Milton. 
He quotes also from Cicero and says 
"they are called versus paralleli, cor- 
relation, correspondents, etc." See 
Faerie Quecne again, 11. iv. 35 ; 11. vi. 
II, 12. Peele has some amazing ex- 
amples, as in Alcazar, Act v. ; and the 
opening lines of David and Bethsabe. 
Spenser varies the form poetically in 
Faerie Queene, 11. xii. 70; and in 
Shepheards Calendar (January) ; Lodge, 
Wounds of Civil War. 

33. long oj] along of, in consequence 
of. Still in useprovincially, and occurs 
again in Love 's Labour 's Lost, 11. i. 119 
(see note, Arden ed. p. 34) ; and in 
Coriolanus, Cymbeline and Midsummer 
Night's Dream. See line 46 below, and 
3 Henry VI. iv. vii. 32.

And on his son young John, whom two hours since 35

York. Alas ! what joy shall noble Talbot have

Away ! vexation almost stops my breath 

That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.

bridge. 53. [Exit] omitted F i. 

37. This seven years] this long time. 
Not to be taiien literally, though dates 
and days are quite plastic in this play. 
A common expression in Shakespeare, 
as in 1 Henry IV. 11. iv. 343, and 2 
Henry VL 11. i. 2. A very old phrase 
occurring in Chaucer's Knightes Talc 
(1. 1452) ; and in Piers Plowman (Skeat's 
edition, vol. i. p. 147), ante 1377 ; in 
most of the early Mystery plays, and 
very common in the 16th century. 
Perpetuated in more than one proverb, 
as " It hapth in one hour that hapth not 
in seven yeare " (Heywood, 1546, etc. 
etc.). 

41. stops my breath] kills me. Com- 
pare Faerie Qiieene, ii. x. 60 : " through 
poison stopped was his breath." 

46. Long all of] all along of, all owing 
to; see line 33 above. 

47, 48. vulture . . . Feeds in the 
bosom] a metaphor from Prometheus 
and Tityus. See Merry Wives of 
Windsor, i. iii. 94 : " Let vultures gripe 
thy guts," and note in Arden edition, 
p. 43. Shakespeare has this allusion 
several times. Perhaps there is no 
commoner loan to the poets from the 



ancients. Twice in Golding's Ovid 
the bird is named a " Grype." 

48. great commanders] Occurs again 
in Troilus and Cressida, and in Henry 
V. Compare Peele, A Tale of Troy 
(558, a) : " The great commander of 
such lordly peers " ; and Locrine, 11. iv. : 
" Albanact, The great commander of 
these regions." 

49. wr^g-Zfc^/on] disregard ; found again 
Troilus and Cressida, i. iii. 127 ; and in 
Pericles, in. iii. 20 (Yi neglect). Halli- 
well gives it as a Gloucestershire pro- 
vincialism. New Eng. Diet, has 
no example earlier than Shakespeare, 
and only one of any sort from Owen 
Feltham. 

50. scarce cold conqueror] Compare 
" scarce cold battle," Cymbeline, v. v. 
469. 

51. ever living man of memory] An 
example of the transposition of words 
so commonly adopted by Shakespeare 
(man of ever living memory). " Ever- 
living " was an early compound. See In- 
troduction ; Faerie Queene, i. i. 38, 
39,41: "ever-damned." This scene is 
undoubtedly Shakespeare's.

the Lords of Montamban and Huma-

. . . discharged their ordinaunce, and

fiture of all my company : thy departure

in the sonne, that neyther desire of

2. To tutor thee] This not common 
verb occurs eight or ten times in Shake- 
speare. See Romeo and yulict. in. i. 32. 

2. stratagems of war] Peele has this 
phrase : " Train'd up in feats and

ence, and thy chair-days." Hardly 
well-turned expressions, either of them, 
poetically. 

6. malignant] having an evil in-

fatall starre malignant " occurs in True 
Tragcdie (Quarto of 3 Henry VI.) at 
II. iii. 8. 

6. ill-boding] See again 5 Henry VI. 
II. vi. 59. Inauspicious. Milton used 
the expression later {New Eng. Diet.). 
No earlier use in New Eng. Diet. 
" Bode " is a favourite with Peele : 
" What chance did bode this ill " {Battle 
of Alcazar, \\ i) ; " sith my stars bode 
me this tragic end " {ibid. 439, a). 

8. utiavoidcd] inevitable. See Rich-

Ovid :— 

" With deadly stripe of unavoyded 
blow

(bk. ii. 11. 760, 761). And again : —

THE FIRST PART OF 



[act 



The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood 

From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood 

Of th}' first fight, I soon encountered, 

And, interchanging blows, I quickly shed 

Some of his bastard blood ; and in disgrace 20 

Bespoke him thus : " Contaminated, base 

And misbegotten blood I spill of thine, 

Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine 

Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy : " 

Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy, 25 

Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care, 

Art thou not weary, John ? how dost thou fare? 

Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly, 

Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry ? 

Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead ; 30 

The help of one stands me in little stead. 

O ! too much folly is it, well I wot, 

To hazard all our lives in one small boat. 

If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage, 

To-morrow I shall die with mickle age: 35 



meaning here is rather the flower, or 
special glory in arms of Gallia — in the 
person of Alen^on, etc. 

16. ireful] Shakespeare had an early 
partiality for this word, afterwards 
neglected. See 3 Henry VI. ii. i. 57 
and II. V. 132; Venus and Adonis, 628, 
and Comedy of Errors, v. i. 151. It is in 
Thcstylis by L. Bryskett, in Spenser's 
Astrophel: "Thy irefull hemes have 
chilld our harts with cold." Sylvester 
uses it in his Dm Bar/as, 1591 (ed. 1621, 
p. 138). 

17. maidenhood] in this figurative 
sense, the word " maidenhead " is com- 
monly used, as in 1 Henry IV. iv. i. 

59- 

22-23. of thine . . . of mine] See 
Part II. I. i. 118 and above, 11. iii. 38. 

29. sofi of chivalry] Elsewhere Shake- 
speare has son of darkness, war, hell 
and fortune. Jonson was fond of this 
figure ; he has son of the sword, silence, 
earth, noise, physic, etc. Lodge has 
" sons of subtlety " {A Fig for Momus). 
Beaumont and Fletcher adopt it freely. 

32. well I wot] In Midsummer 
Night's Dream, iii. ii. 422. Elsewhere 
this expression is found only in the 
historical plays, as Richard II. v. vi. 
18; 3 Henry VI. 11. ii. 134, iv. vii. 83 
and V. iv. 71. It is characteristic of 
Greene ; he uses it four times in 



Alphonsus, King of Arragon (Grosart, 
xiii. 361, 362, 398, 402) ; and again in 
A Looking Glasse for London (x'lv. 104). 
Hence it has been made a test of 
Greene's handiwork. But Peele has it 
in A Farewell to the General (1589) 
and twice in Polyhymnia, and twice in 
yack Stratv. Peele would know it 
from his favourite Faerie Queene, for it 
is found four times in the first two 
books. All of these writers would 
have known it from Grafton's Chronicle 
in Richard II. 's speech on his deposi- 
tion (i. 476) : " For well I 7i)ote and 
knowlege and deme my selfe to be, 
and have bene, insufficient," etc. 
Probably " well I wot " came from the 
North, like many other expressions at 
this date (1550-1600). It occurs several 
times in The Townely Mysteries {circa 
1460). Richard II. 's speech was in 
1389. 

33. hazard all . . . one small boat] 
Compare Merchant of Venice, i. i. 42 : 
" My ventures are not in one bottom 
trusted." This latter expression be- 
came a common proverb, but I have no 
example of the boat phrase. 

35. mickle age] Occurs aga'tn 2 Henry 
VI. V. i. 174 : " That liows unto the 
grave with mickle age." " Mickle " is a 
scarce word in Shakespeare, met with 
again in Romeo and Juliet, Comedy of 



sc. VI.] KING HENRY THE SIXTH 125 

By me they nothing gain an if 1 stay; 

'Tis but the short'ning of my h'fe one day. 

In thee thy mother dies, our household's name, 

My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame. 

All these and more we hazard by thy stay ; 40 

All these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away. 
John. The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart ; 

These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart. 

On that advantage, bought with such a shame, 

To save a paltry life and slay bright fame, 45

And like me to the peasant boys of France, 

To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance !

An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son : 

Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot ; 

If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot. 
Tal. Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete, 

Thou Icarus. Thy life to me is sweet : 55 

If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side.

Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee. 

When he perceived me shrink and on my knee, 5 

His bloody sword he brandishVi over me, 

And like a hungry lion did commence 

Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience ; 

But when my angry guardant stood alone, 

Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none, 10 

Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart 

Suddenly made him from my side to start 

Into the clust'ring battle of the French ; 

And in that sea of blood my boy did drench 

His over-mounting spirit ; and there died 1 5

3. Triumphant death, smear'd with 
captivity] Talbot exults that death has 
triumphed over him, with no blemish of 
captivity. Death, the conqueror dis- 
graced by captivity, has triumphed. 
" With " means " by," as it often does. 
Talbot means to welcome death, free 
from the stain himself of captivity. He 
is greater than death. 

7. hungry lion] See note, i. ii. 28. 

9. guardant ]pTOtectOT, guard. Com- 
pare Coriolanus, v. ii. 67. Seems to be 
a peculiarly Shakespearian use. 

10. Tend'ring my ruin] solicitous, 
tenderly anxious, over my fall. Com- 
pare Winter's Tale, 11. iii. 128, 133 
(Schmidt). It is almost hopeless to 
assign a meaning, within verbal limits, 
to the verb tender, which was mixed up 
with the adjective tender on the one 
side, and the verb tender (for acceptance) 
on the other. Greene does the same. 
Compare too Whetstone's Promos and 
Cassandra, Part I. (p. 8, Six Old 
Plays, Argument), 1578: "The kinge 
tendringe the general! benefit of the 
common weale." This is the legitimate 
sense; as in Grttne's yames the Fourth 
(xiii. 269) : — 



" I love, I tender thee 
Thou art a subject fit to serve his 
grace." 
And his Cardeof Fancie (iv. 165) : " The 
young storkes so tender the old ones in 
their age, as they will not suffer them so 
much as to flie to get their owne living." 
And A Maidens Dreame (xiv. 304) : — 
"And like a father that affection 
beares 
So tendred he the poore with in- 
ward teares." 
See Part II. iii. i. 277 (note). 

II. Dizzy-eyed] giddy, dazzled. 
Shakespeare has from fifteen to twenty 
compounds ending in eyed. 

13. clust'ring] crowding, swarming. 
Compare Greene, Alphonsus (xiii. 333): 
" Such clients clustred to thy Court." 

14. blood . . . drench] Peele has 
" Thus into a lake of blood . . . 

Hath drencht himself." 
And in Locrine, ii. 4: " dreiiched in my 
foemen's blood."

lerophon." 
For " blossom," see note, 3 Henry VI. 
V. V. 62. 

18. Thou antic death] See Richard 
II. III. ii. 162. The buffoon, death. 
See too "old father Antic the law," 
1 Henry IV. 1. ii. 6g. Greene opened 
his play, The Scottish Hystorie of 
lames the Fourth, with " a dance of 
Antiques" (Grosart, xiii. 205, 209). 

19. Anon] A favourite line-beginning 
with Shakespeare. 

ig. insulting' tyranny] See again 
Richard III. 11. iv. 51: "Insulting 
tyranny begins to jet." See i. ii. 138 
above, and note. The passage there is 
the earliest containing this word in New 
Eng. Diet. ; the verb being a little 
earlier (1572, Lambarde's Kent). This 
adjective is found in Shakespeare again 



in Lucrece, 509, in Richard II. and 1 
Henry IV. Compare Greene's Mena- 
phon (Grosart, vi. 98) : " tyrannising so 
Lordlie ouer his boies . . . insulting 
ouer their children" (1589). 

21. /i;//f?'] pliant, supple. New Eng. 
Diet, quotes Cooper's Thesaurus (1565) 
for this sense of a much earlier word. 
As Craig first pointed out, Shakespeare 
found it in Golding's Ovid (1565-1567). 
He quotes two passages containing 
"lither air" (viii. 1. 1027, xiv. 1. 489). 
Elsewhere Golding has : " And in his 
lither hand he hilld a potte of wyne " 
(xii. 351); and "the drowzye God of 
sleepe his lither limbes dooth rest" (xi. 
711). Golding had consulted Cooper? 
The word belongs to his 1567 transla- 
tions. 

23. hard-favoured] See 3 Henry VI. 
V. v. 78. It occurs nine times in Shake- 
speare. Found in Greene, and earlier. 

25. whether he will or 710] A common 
expression in Shakespeare, occurring 
in The Tempest, Midsummer Night's 
Dream, 2 Henry VI., etc. 

25. will or no] See Part II. in. ii. 265. 

27. as who should say] See note at 
I. iv. 93 above.

Puc. Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said : 

" Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid ; " 

But with a proud majestical high scorn, 

He answer'd thus : " Young Talbot was not born 40 

To be the pillage of a giglot wench." 

So, rushing in the bowels of the French, 

He left me proudly, as unworthy fight. 
Bur. Doubtless he would have made a noble knight; 

See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms 45 

Of the most bloody nurser of his harms.

" Raging mad " is not hyphened now, 
for example.

Dream, 11. i. 192. Greene has it in 
Orlando Furioso (xiii. 161) : " Franticke 
companion, lunaticke and wood." 
Several times in Spenser's Faerie 
Queene, and in Peele's Edward I. 

36. jflesh . . . sword] Compare 1 
Henry IV. v. iv. 133 : — 

"full bravely hast thou flesh'd

We English warriors wot not what it means. 55 

I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en 
And to survey the bodies of the dead. 

Cha. For prisoners ask'st thou ? hell our prison is. 
But tell me whom thou seek'st. 

Lucy. But where 's the great Alcides of the field, 60 

Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury? 
Created, for his rare success in arms, 
Great Earl of Wash ford, Waterford, and Valence; 
Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield, 
Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton, 65 
Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield, 
The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge, 
Knight of the noble order of Saint George, 
Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece, 
Great marshal to Henry the Sixth yo 

Of all his wars within the realm of France? 

Puc. Here is a silly stately style indeed ! 

The Turk, that two-and-fifty kingdoms hath. 
Writes not so tedious a style as this. 



70. Henry] F i ; our King Henry Ff 2, 3, 4. 
Dyce. 



72. silly stately] silly-stately 



60. the great Alcides] Greene men- 
tions Alcides in Menaphon (vi. 89) ; 
but none of the poets use the name as 
freely as Shakespeare. Spenser speaks 
of "great Alcides" [Faerie Qiieene, I. 
vii. 17). See above, 11. iii. 18. 

67. thrice-victorious] See Introduc- 
tion. 

71. realm of France] See note, 11. ii. 

36- . . 

72. Here is . . . indeed] Compare this 
interjected line with 11. iii. 56. 

72. silly stately style] Boswell Stone 
quotes this epitaph on Talbot, in almost 
exactly the same words, from Richard 
Crompton's Mansion of Magnanimitie, 
1599, sig. E 4, from whom it was 
copied into Ralph Brooke's Catalogue 
and Succession of the Kings, etc. etc. 
(ed. 16 19, p. 196), with one or two very 
trifling changes., Boswell Stone says 
Crompton has a marginal note " Cam- 
den, 462," but a reference to Camden 
(ed. 1594), at that page, has merely a 
notice of Talbot's tomb at Whitchurch, 
and does not even quote another epi- 
taph on Talbot once existing at Whit- 
church. No other edition (says 
Stone) of Cam.cjen, prigr to 1599, con- 



tains any reference to Talbot at p. 462. 
Camden, in his Rcmaines Concerning 
Britaine (ed. 1623, p. 332), mentions 
that he has " elsewhere noted the Epi- 
taph " of "the terrour of France". 
And in his Britannia (ed. 1610, p. 598) 
he gives it in Latin and English : 
" Orate Pro Anima . . . that is : Pray 
for the soule of the right Noble Lord, 
Sir lohn Talbot, sometimes Earle of 
Shrewsburie, Lord Talbot, Lord Furni- 
vall. Lord Verdon, Lord Strange de 
Black-Mere, and Mareshall of France : 
Who died in the battaile at Burdews, 
VII. lulii. M.cccc.Liii." If Crompton 
had authority earlier than Shakespeare, 
it would be vastly interesting to know 
what it was. Apparently he amended 
Camden by a reference to this pas- 
sage. 

73. Turk] Compare the account of 
Bejazeth's dignities in Marlowe's Tam- 
burlaine, Part I. Act in., and else- 
where. Shakespeare probably refers to 
this silly-stately language in Marlowe's 
play here. He has "successive heir" 
(in Part II. ill. i. 49) ; "all the hundred 
and thirty kingdoms" of the Turk 
occurs.

Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles 75 

Stinking and fl}'-blo\vn lies here at our feet. 
Lucy. Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge, 

Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis? 

O ! were mine cj'cballs into bullets turned, 

That I in rage might shoot them at your faces. 80 

O ! that I could but call these dead to life, 

It were enough to fright the realm of France. 

Were but his picture left amongst you here 

It would amaze the proudest of you all. 

Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence 85 

And give them burial as beseems their worth. 
Puc. I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost, 

He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit. 

For God's sake, let him have him ; to keep them here 

They would but stink and putrefy the air. 90 

88. proud commanding] proud-commanding ?).\Na\k&r {con].). ' 89. /uw] Ff; 
V;m Theobald, C;imbridge. 



75. viagnijiest] Not elsewhere in 
Shakespeare. 

76. fly-blown'] Earlier in Gabriel 
Harvey, several times ; but not again 
in Shakespeare. Compare The Tem- 
pest, V. i. 284. 

78. Nemesis] Not met again in 
Shakespeare. Gascoigne calls on 
Nemesis in two places in his Complaynt 
of Philomene (Arber, pp. 8g, 114), 1576. 
Peele has her several times in the 
Battle of Alcazar : — 

^'Nemesis, high mistress of revenge, 
That with her scourge keeps all 
the world in awe " 
(ed. Dyce, 42 r, b). And Greene in 
Orlando Furioso (xiii. 193) : " Angry 
Nemesis sits on my sword " ; and earlier 
in Orpharion. 

79. eyeballs] See Part II. iii. ii. 49 
and 169 (note). 

84. the proudest of you all] See 
Merry Wives of Windsor, 11. ii. 77; 
Taming of the Shrew, iv. i. Hg ; 
Richard III. 11. i. 128. An expression 
of Greene's : " A companie of scabbes, 
the proudest of you all drawe your 
weapon if he can " (Frier Bacon, 
Gxosart, xiii. 31) ; and in Alphonsiis 
(xiii. 396) :— 

" How now sir boy ? let Amurack 
himselfe, 
Or any he, the proudest of you all. 
But offer once for to unsheath his 
sword," 



One of these lines is found in 3 Henry 
VI. II. ii. 96 : — 

" here I stand to answer thee, 
Or any he, the proudest of thy 
sort." 
But the expression comes from Hall (or 
Grafton). Speaking of a wish on the 
part of certain noblemen to deface 
Bedford's tomb at Roan, King Lewis 
the XI. said: " let his body now lye in 
rest, which when he was alyve would 
have disquieted the proudest of iis all" 
(Grafton, i. 606). 

88. proud commanding spirit] Com- 
pare "proud insulting," i.ii. i38(see note). 
Greene has " proud injurious," " proud 
blasphemous"; Peele, "proud usurping." 
The word seemed to require help. Mar- 
lowe has " proud usurping" in Tambur- 
laine, Part II. iii. i., probably earlier 
than Peele's Alcazar, i. i. I believe 
they all picked it up from Spenser's 
Faerie Qiieene : "proud presumptuous 
gate " (gait), i. viii. 12 ; " proud avenging 
boy" (Cupid), i. ix, 12, etc. etc. See 
Peele and Greene, passim. Spenser has 
"proud rebellious," 11. v, 10; "proud 
presumed force," Faerie Queene, 11. vi. 
30; "proud luxurious pomp," i. xii. 14. 

8g. have him] Referring to Talbot, 
the most prominent spirit, and the body 
Lucy has come to seek (I. 59). 'Em 
was not a common contraction at the 
date of thi-; play — if known at all. It 
must be rejected.

In the beginning of this scene two 
historical events of different dates are 
again combined : the interference of 
the pope, and the proffer of marriage to 
King Henry. In " The XIIJ Yere " 
(1434), Grafton ^vrites (p. 602) : " The 
crie and noyse of this perillous and in- 
saciable vvarre, was blasted through 
Europe, detested through Christendome, 
and especially at the counsaile of Basill. 
, . . Wherefore, the Emperour and the 
temporall Princes . . . desired Eugeny 
then Bishop of Rome, to be the aucth- 
our and Arbiter of that great strife. 
. . . Wherefore by aucthoritie of this 
generall Counsaill, two Cardinals came 
to the towne of Arras, . . . whither were 
sent for the King of England . . . 
Winchester . . . Yorke . . . Suffolke . . . 
and for the French King . . . Burbon 
. . . Vandosme. . . . Upon the day of 
the first session, the Cardinall . . . 
declared to the three parties the in- 
numerable mischiefes . . . exhorting and 
requiring them for the honor of God 
. . . that they would laye all rancour 
aparte . . . and conforme themselves 
to reason and to godly concorde. . . . 
After which admonition . . . euery parte 
brought in their demaunde which were 
most contrary. . . . The Cardinailes 
. . . offered . . . condicions . . . both 
parties . . . openly refused : In so much 
as the English men in great displeasure 
departed to Calice, and so intoEngland." 
In "The XXIJ Yere" (1443), P- 623, 



Grafton has : " All christendome la- 
mented the continuall destruction of so 
noble a realme, and the effusion of so 
muck christian blood, wherfore to ap- 
pease the mortall warre . . . there 
was a great diet appointed, to be 
kept at the Citie of Tours in Tourayne, 
where for the King of England appered 
William de la Pole, Erie of Suffolke . . . 
the Erie of Suffolk, extending his com- 
mission to the uttermost . . . because 
the French King had no daughter of ripe 
age . . . desired to have the Ladye 
Margaret, Cosyn to the French King, 
and daughter to Reyner Duke of Aniow, 
callyng himselfe King of Sicile, Naples,

The Duke was not heard, but the 
Erles doings were condiscended unto

such a flame, that it never went out, 
till bothe the parties with many other 
were consumed and slaine." The 
underlined passage above shows that 
Shakespeare used Hall or Grafton here, 
not Holinshed. 

A considerable part of the machinery 
of Act V. is covered by these two ex- 
tracts, especially the latter one. But 
it must be again repeated that history 
is in kaleidoscopic confusion. Very 
few traces of Shakespeare's work ap- 
pear in this Act. From Scene iii. on- 
wards, none. 

5. concluded of] For the needless 
" of," see note at in. iv. 29. 

9. effusion . . . blood] For this line 
see the extract from Grafton at the 
opening of the Act. See also Henry V. 
III. vi. 138. And Locrine, 11. i. (quoted 
at "ruthful," Part III.). "Effusion of 
Christian blood " occurs twice on one 
page of Holinshed, thirty-eighth year of 
Henry VI. " Effuse of blood " occurs 
in 3 Henry VI. 11. vi. 28. 

10. stablish] Not elsewhere in Shake- 



speare's plays. " Stablishment " occurs 
in Antony and Cleopatra. A very old 
form found in Piers Plowman (as " stab- 
lisse "). And in Grafton's Chronicle 
(vol. i. p. 359) : " the King [Edward the 
Thirde] builded a Chappell of Saint 
George within the sayde Castell of 
Windsore, and stablished therein cer- 
tein Chanons . . . and endued them 
with . . . possessions." • 

13. immanity] ferocity, monstrous 
cruelty. New Eng. Diet, has an earlier 
example. Not again in Shakespeare. 
Compare A Warning for Faire Women, 
ii. line 873 (Simpson's School of Shake- 
speare) : " The horror of their foule 
immanity " (1599). 

17. A»i/] tied by relationship. "Knit" 
and "knot" werefrequently brought into 
juxtaposition, as here. See Coriolanus, 
IV. ii. 32; Titus Andronicns, iii. ii. 4; 
Antony and Cleopatra, 11. ii. 129 ; 
Romeo and Jidiet, iv. ii. 24, and Merry 
Wives of Windsor, iii. ii. 76. See 
Greene's Mamillia (Grosart, ii. 64), 
1583, quoted in Arden edition of Merry 
Wives of Windsor, p. 124 ; and his 
Looking Glassefor Lo7idon (xiv. no) : — 
" come, with a holy band 
Lets knit a knot to salve our former 
shame." 
Compare Grafton, i. 657 : "their hartes 
were knit and coupled in one." 

20. sumptuous] Occurs again once in 
1 Henry IV. and twice in H Henry VI. ; 
the adverb in Titus Atidronicus. Greene

2. charming spells] varied to " spell- 
ing charms," below (1. 31). 

2. periapts] inscribed bandages or 
charms. From Scot's Discoverie of 
Witchcraft (1584), where the term is 
used several times. " These vertues 
under these verses . . . are conteinefl 
in a periapt or tablet, to be continuallie 
worne about one, called Agyius Dei" 
(reprint, p. 185). This chapter (bk. xii. 
ch. ix.) is headed " Popish periapts, 
amulets and charms," etc. etc. No- 
where else in Shakespeare. 

3, 4. admonish fne . . . of future 
accidents] notify, or inform me of them. 
Compare Golding's Ovid (xi. 442) : 
" His wyfe Alcyone by the noyse ad- 
monisht of the same." Wrongly ex- 
plained by Schmidt, with reference to 
a different use in Hebrews viii. 5. 

6. lordly monarch of the north] Out 
of the north all ill (spirits) came forth. 
Many references might be cited from 
the Discoverie of Witchcraft, bk. xv. 
Two will suffice : " How to raise and 
exorcize all sorts of Spirits belonging 
to the Airy Region " (p. 481) (see 
"regions" in line 11). And: "A form 
of conjuring Luridan the Familiar. . . . 
Luridan is a Familiar Domestick Spirit 
of the North, who is now become Ser- 
vant to Balkin, Lord and king of the 
Northern Mountains" (p. 485). In 



another place (p. 327) Zimimar is " king 
of the north." But Greene is the 
authority here to be noticed most. 
Compare Frier Bacon (Grosart, xiii. 
62):— 

" Bacon, that bridles headstrong 
Belcephon, 
And rules Asmenoth, guider of the 

North, 
Bindes me from yielding unto Van- 
dermast." 
And p. 81 : — 

" But proud Astmeroth, ruler of the 
North, 
And Demegorgon maister of the 

fates. 
Grudge that a mortall man should 

worke so much ; 
Hell trembled. . . Fiendesfrown'd," 
etc. 
II. regions under earth] Steevens 
very pertinently asks, with reference to 
Singer's ridiculous alteration of the text 
(to "legions"): " The regions under earth 
are the infernal regions. Whence else 
should the sorceress have selected or 
summoned her fiends ? " She might 
have had them from other regions (see 
lastnote),buttheword "powerful" shows 
she needs those out of Erebus itself. 
" Powerful regions" are the homes of the 
powerful. Compare Marlowe, Tambur- 
laine. Part II. iv. 3 (65, a) : " O thou that

14. feed yon with my blood] I find no 
note to this passage. We have already 
had a blood-superstition (i. v. 6) with 
regard to witches. This relates to their 
dealings with the familiar or devil from 
which they derive their powers. Pro- 
bably the belief was common amongst 
peasants, and will be found illustrated 
in early trials. Scot does not, I think, 
refer to it anywhere. On the contrary, 
part of his refutation that he insists 
upon, is that devils are bloodless, and do 
not need or care for blood ; and in the 
first chapter of the third book " The 
witches bargaine with the devill, ac- 
cording to . . . Bodin," etc. etc., this is 
no part of the compact. Witches had 
fifteen crimes laid to their charge (p. 
26), one of which was that " They eate 
the flesh and dnnke the bloud of 
men, women and children openly." So 
much for Scot on this point. In Middle- 
ton's Witch (BuUen's edition, v. 417) ; — 
" [/4 spirit like a cat descends. 
Voice above. Hecate. 
"There's one comes down to fetch 
his dues, 

A kiss, a coll, a sip of blood; 

And why thou stayst so long, 
I muse, I muse" 
{circa i5io). A fuller example is in 
Ford's^ Witch of Edmonton. Mother 



Sawyer obtains the services of the devil 
in the shape of a black dog. " Enter a 
Black Dog. Ho ! have I found thee 
cursing? now thou art Mine own" 
(Dyce's ed. iii. 201). He then makes 
her to " make a deed of gift Of soul and 
body to me . . . And seal it with thy 
blood . . . [She pricks her arm, which 
he sucks. Thunder and lightning.^' He 
then executes her wishes (of revenge) 
on an old churl, and continues to do 
so, receiving his due each time she 
summons him, until he is weary and 
refuses to partake, when he leaves her 
to her fate — playing the devil with her 
in fact. The date of this play is about 
1625. Mephistopheles found no such 
carnal attraction in Faustus, although 
he required his blood for writing pur- 
poses.

The "woomg of Margaret" belongs to 
1443-4 ! see note at beginning of this 
Act. The loss of Paris had occurred 
before the play opened ; see note at iii. 
ii. 3. And 1430 (May 23) "is the 
historic date of La Pucelle's capture. 
On that day she accompanied a sally 
from Compiegne, then besieged by the 
English and Burgundians, and was 
taken before she could re-enter the 
town. Bedford was ' Regent ' (i. i.) at 
the time, but the dramatist killed him in 
Act III. sc. ii. York — -whose prisoner 
she becomes in this scene — held no such 
post until 1436." I quote here from 
Boswell Stone.' Any arrangement of 
dates is only distracting. That way 
madness lies. Here is Grafton's ac- 
count of Joan's capture (The IX. Yere, 
p. 58S) : " And it happened in the night 
of the Ascention of our Lorde, that Pon- 
thon of Xentrales, lone the Puzell, and 
fiue or sixe hundred men of armes issued 
out of Compeigne by the gate of the 



bridge . . . they assembled a great 
number of men, as well English as 
Burgonions, and couragiously set on the 
Frenche men. Sore was the fight and 
great was the slaughter, in so much that 
the French men, not able longer to in- 
dure, fled into the towne so fast, that 
one letted the other to enter. In which 
chace was taken, lone the Puzell and 
diuers other : which lone was sent to 
the Duke of Bedford to Roan, where 
(after long examination) she was brent 
to ashes. This witch or manly woman 
(called the mayde of God) the French 
men greatly glorified and highly extoled, 
alleging that by her Orleaunce was 
vitayled ; by her King Charles was sacred 
at Reynes. . . . What blot is this to the 
French Nation ! What more rebuke can 
be imputed to a renowned Region, then 
to affirme . . . that all notable victories 
. . . were gotten and achiued by a shep- 
herdes daughter, a Chamberlein in an 
hostrie, and a beggersbrat : which blind- 
ing the wittes of the French nation, by 
reuelations, dreames, and phantasticall 
visions, made them beleue things not to

the same is long [over 100 long lines —

rehearse the eftect thereof. . . . And 
for a true declaration of the falsitie and 
lewdnesse of her doing, she being called 
before the Byshop and the Vniversity of 
Pares, was there with great solempnity 
adjudged and condempned a super-

And our nobility will scorn the match. 

85. random] Ff 3, 4; randon Ff i, 2. 



78, 79. She 's beautiful . . . She is a 
woman] A stock expression of Greene's, 
and repeated in Titus Andronicus, 11. i. 
82, 83. Greene has it as follows : " Pa- 
sylla was a woman, and therefore to be 
wonne : if 6£?a?tiJ/7</ with prayses; ifcoie 
with praiers" [Planctomachia (Grosart, 
V. 56), 1585) ; ''shee is a woman and there- 
fore to be wonne with prayses or pro- 
mises, for that shee is a jvoman " [ibid. 
no). The first passage is repeated in 
Perymedes the Blacksmith (vii. 68). He 
has it again in Orpharion (xii. 31) ; 
and at page 78 in Orpharion (1588 ?) : 
" Argentina is a woman & therfore to 
be wooed, & so to be won." See again 
in Richard III. i. ii. 228, 22g. 

82. paramour] See v. i. 23 (note). 

84. a cooling card] anything that 
checks one's enthusiasm or moderates 
one's transports — a cooler. Not again in 
Shakespeare. New Eng. Diet, quotes 
it from Holinshed's Chronicle, iii. 188 
(1577). Greene made this expression one 
of his special characteristics, taking it, 
like much of his writing, out of Lyly's 
Euphues, 1579-80: " that he might bridle 
the overlashing affections . . . which he 
termed a cooling card" (Arber, p. 105). 
It occurs also in Gabriel Harvey's 
Letters (Grosart. i. 139), 1573 ; in Muce- 
dorus (Hazlitt's Dodsley, vii. 250), 1598 ; 
in Xashe's Have with you, etc., 1596 ; in 
Beaumont and Fletcher's Island Prin- 



cess, Act I. ; and as late as Dryden's 
Kind Keeper, i. i. (1675). Greene has it 
in the Dedicatory Epistle to Mamillia 
(his first known piece) : " there is not a 
greater cooling carde to a rash wit than 
want" (Grosart, ii. 6), 1583; and twice, 
later, in the same piece — and indeed it is 
constant through his interminable prose 
tracts. I wish to enforce this because it 
is a fair view of a most distorted bit of 
evidence given by Fleay several times, 
who makes this expression a test of 
Lodge because he found it in The 
Wounds of Civil War (Hazlitt's Dods- 
ley, vii. 155), 1594. See his English 
Drama, ii. 49 ; and his other Lodge-test, 
" rasors of Palermo," given there also, is 
in Edward's Damon and Pithias {ante 
1566). Gabriel Harvey (1573) is perhaps 
the earliest user of this phrase. 

85. He talks at random] recklessly. 
Occurs again (with verb of action) in Two 
Gentlemen of Verona, 11. i. 117. Greene 
uses it often in his prose, as though 
specially belonging to archery or marks- 
manship. Compare North's Plutarch 
(Tudor trans, i. 148, Lycurgus), 1579 : 
" They dyd never use to speake vaine 
wordes at randone " ; and Golding's 
Ovid (viii. 301) : " To fly at randon."'

And then I need not crave his courtesy. 105

Suf. Lady, wherefore talk you so ? 
Mar. I cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo. 
Suf Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose no 

Your bondage happy to be made a queen ? 
Mar. To be a queen in bondage is more vile 

Than is a slave in base servility ; 

For princes should be free. 
Suf. And so shall you, 

If happy England's royal king be free. 1 1 5

a blush, a flower's hue), is common in 
Greene, verb and noun. "Love" here 
has an impure sense of lust. Shake- 
speare uses "taint" or " tainted with " 
as a reproach in the plays. See Part 
III. III. i. 40. 

186. peevish] silly, foolish. 

188, 189. labyrinth ; There Mino- 
taurs] " Minotaurs," meaning monsters, 
is seldom found in the plural, but it 
occurs in Greene's Never too Late 
(Grosart, viii. 104), ante 1590: "Here 
be such monstrous Minotaures as first 
devour the threed, and then the person." 
See too Spenser, Faerie Queene, iii. 
X. 40. Shakespeare has no other men- 
tion of the Minotaur, but he appears 
very frequently' in Greene's euphu- 
istical love-tales. Spenser has them 
again in Mother Hnbberd's Tale : 
" Griffons, Minotaures, Crocodiles, 
Dragons, Beavers and Centaures." 

192. natural graces . . . art] Com- 
pare for this sentiment, King Lear, iv. 
vi. 86; Alls Well that Ends Well, n. 
i. 121; Timon of Athens, V. i. 88, etc. 

iga. extinguish] Only again in Lu- 
crece, 313. 

193. Repeat their semblance] repro- 
duce the mental representation of them. 
Shakespeare was decidedly affected to 
this word "semblance," but it is rather 
obscure here. Compare Greene, James 
the Fourth (Grosart, xiii. 291) : — 

" Go to mine Ida, tell her that my 
soule 



[Exit. 



192. And] Capell ; Mad F i ; Made Ff 



Shall keepe her semblance closed 
in my brest." 
Greene uses the word with the meaning 
recognition in Maviillia (ii. 55): "She 
passed on without any semblance of his 
sight" — an obsolete sense that might 
better explain this line. See extract 
from Holinshed at i. ii. 50, for the 
ordinary use of " semblance." 

The foregoing scene is composed of 
such simple featureless verse, since Mar- 
garet's appearance, that it is scarcely 
capable of identification. The frequent 
occurrence of " prmcely " — five times in 
100 lines — a favourite word with Greene, 
recalls that writer, but he is rarely so 
prosaic. In Greene's Frier Bacon Lacy 
courts Margaret, the keeper's daughter, 
for himself when he should be wooing 
her for his prince (Henry the Third's 
son), but beyond this outline the parallel 
does not stretch. For the " traffic " be- 
tween Reignier and Suffolk see extract 
at the beginning of the Act, which 
covers the following scene as well, 
time and place being disregarded his- 
torically. The transition of method 
and style, or from one hand and mind 
to another, is nowhere more marked in 
this play than between this scene and 
its successor, however delightful be the 
matter. In the later plays we shall see 
that Margaret becomes a more finished 
and important poetical creation at the 
hands of Shakespeare himself.

Enter YORK, WARWICK, and Others. 
York. Bring forth that sorceress, condemn'd to burn. 

Enter La i^MCYAA.Y. guarded, and a Shepherd. 

Shep. Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright ! 
Have I sought every country far and near, 
And, now it is my chance to find thee out, 
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death ? 
Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I '11 die with thee ! 

Puc. Decrepit miser ! base ignoble wretch ! 
I am descended of a gentler blood : 
Thou art no father nor no friend of. mine. 

Shep. Out, out ! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so ; 
I did beget her all the parish knows : 
Her mother liveth yet, can testify 
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship. 



10 



2. kills thy father's heart] An old ex- 
pression ; see Love's Labour 's Lost, v. 
ii. 149, note, Arden edition, p. 131. 
See again As You Like It, iii. ii. 260; 
Winter's Talc, iv. iii, 88 ; Richard IL 
V. i. 100; Henry the Fifth, 11. i. 92. 

3. sought] searched; used here as 
though it were the participle of 
" search," not " seek." Compare " un- 
sought" in Comedy of Errors, 1. i. 136. 

5. timeless] untimely, premature. A 
Shakespearian word. See Two Gentle- 
men of Verona, in. i. 21 ; Richard IL 

IV. i. 5 ; 3 Henry VI. in. ii. 187, and 

V. vi. 42 ; Richard III. i. ii. 117 ; Titus 
Andronicus, 11. iii. 265 ; Romeo and 
jftiliet, V. iii. 162. Steevens gave an 
example of " timeless death " from 
Drayton's Legetid of Robert Duke of 
Normandy (taken from here), 1596. A 
regular Marlowe use. Compare Tam- 
burlaine. Part II. (last lines) : " Let 
earth and heaven his timeless death de- 
plore." And Edward the Second (Dyce, 
186, a) :— 

" This ground . . . 
Shall be their timeless sepulchre or 
mine." 
And The Massacre at Paris (begin- 
ning) :— 

" the blood of innocents, 
That Guise hath slain by treason 

of his heart, 
And brought by murder to their 
timeless ends." 



Without finding Marlowe's own work 
in this, as in other doubtful plays, we 
find his influence on Shakespeare, for 
this scene is Shakespeare's own. In 
the case of Greene, one sees Shake- 
speare's remodelling of him. Peele 
has [Old Wives Tale, 457, a): "And 
now my timeless date is come to end 
[Dies]," where the sense is rather pre- 
viously undetermined (compare iv. vi. 9). 

7. Decrepit] See Love's Labour's 
Lost, I. i. 139 ; Venus and Adonis, 1148 ; 
Sonnet 37. Worn with age. 

7. miser] a miserable wretch. Not 
elsewhere in Shakespeare in this sense. 
Compare Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadia, 
book ii. (ed. 173S, ii. p. 217) : " Most 
blessed paper, which shalt kiss that 
hand, whereto all blessedness is in 
nature a servant, do not yet disdain 
to carry with thee the woeful words of 
a miser now despairing" (ante 1586). 
Steevens quotes from Holinshed, and 
from Jacob and Esau, 1568. No doubt 
Spenser gave the word fresh life in 
Faerie Queene, 11. i. 9, and 11. iii. 8. 

7. t'o-woi/f] of low descent. See above 
III. i. 178; 3 Henry VI. iv. i. 70, and 
Richard III. in. vii. 127. 

8. gentler blood] See iv. i. 44 above, 
and note. " Men, noble and ignoble," 
occurs in the chroniclers Fabyan, Hall 
and Grafton.

ii. 98, it is "first fruits" (plural for

Lamb's Elia. See note below at 
"attorneyship," v. v. 56. 

14. 20, 32. deny] disown. Compare 
Romeo and Juliet, 11. ii. 34. 

15. Thii argues . . . kind of life] 
Compare 2 Henry VI. in. iii. 30; "So 
bad a death argues a monstrous life." 
See too Othello, in. iv. 38. This is 
evidence of Shakespeare, if needs be. 

17. obstacle] "An old vulgar corrup- 
tion of ' obstinate,' which has oddly 
lasted since our author's time till now " 
(Johnson). i\Va» Eng. Diet, has an 
example from a 1536 Will. Steevens 
quotes from Chapman's May Day 
(161 1) and The Tragedy of Hoffman, 
1631. He says further: "It may be 
met with in Gower." 

18. a collop of my flesh] Ritson 
quoted from The History of Morindos 
and Miranda, i6og — a far cry. The 
expression is an old one, occurring in 
Goldmg's Ovid (v. 650-651) : — 

"... my daughter is a Jewell deare 
and leefe ; 
A collup of mine owne flesh cut as 
well as out of thint." 
So, too, in Hcv'wood's Proverbs (1546), 
edited by Sharman, p. 49 : " For I have 
heard say. it is a deare collup that is cut 
of th' owne flesh." 

23. noble] Johnson made out some 
far-fetched explanation here "of the 
nobleman and royal man" (J King 



Henry IV\ 11. iv. 321) which I have not 
pursued. The shepherd alTccts not to 
understand any meaning of "noble" 
except the pecuniary one, in a quite 
Shakcspe.irian way. In " The XV 
Yerc " of Edward the Third, Grafton 
says (vol. i. p. 347): "And in this yere 
the king caused a new coyne of Gold 
to be coyned called the Nolle, of the 
value of vj shillings viij pence or ix 
pence, &c. Wherein was mixed and 
quartered the armes of Fraunce and 
England" (1339-1340). 

25. good my girl] A favourite trans- 
position of Shakespeare's, occurring in 
the majority of his plays. See note at 
Love's Labour 's Lost, ill. i. 144 (Ardcn 
edition, p. 52). 

27. tiativity] See Comedy of Errors, 
tv. iv. 32 and As You Like It, iv. i. 36. 
Not commonly used in the ordinary 
sense of birth. For the sentiment com- 
pare Greene's Georgc-a-Greeiic (Grosart, 
xiv. 131):— 

" I say. Sir Gilbert, looking on my 
daughter, 
I curse the houre that ere 1 got the 
girle." 
And Faerie Qucene, iii. vi. 2 : — 
" The Hevens . . . 
Looking with myld aspect upon the 

earth 
In th' Horoscope of her nativitee." 

28. suck'dst] See note at " meant'st," 
III. ii. 222, Part II. Occurs again 
Coriolanus, ill. ii. 129, and Titus An- 
dronicus, 11. iii. 144. The use of these 
forms, now stilted or disused, belonged 
to the formerly much commoner " thou " 
and " thee." As in biblical language.

Harvey says : " So Caesar Borgia, the 
souerain Type of Machiavels Prince,

day " (Pierces Supererogation (Grosart, 
ii. 305-306), 1592). By stratagem and 
sudden assault. My Iriend, Mr. Francis 
Worllett, sends me an interesting note 
on Machiavel, with regard to Alencon. 
Machiavel was known chiefly to Eliza- 
bethans from the F'renchman Gentillet, 
not from the Italian. Of course one 
excepts Bacon, who appreciated him, 
as possibly did also Harvey. Gentillet's 
Discourse against Machiavel is a 
French refutation or misrepresentation 
of him, published in 1576. The preface 
to the English version is dated 1577, 
although the first printed edition we 
have is much later. The French book 
was dedicated to the Due d'Alenc^on, 
and Gentillet brought upon himself 
much ridicule by not knowing that the 
Duke was a most notorious Machiavel. 
This tones down the anachronism into 
an interesting topical allusion in the 
passage in the text. Hall tells us that 
John, Duke of Alenc^on, who was exe- 
cuted in France in Henry's thirty-sixth 
year, was accused of high treason and 
of conspiring with the English to re- 
cover Normandy, whereupon he suffered 
death very unjustly. He had been a 
prisoner and well entertained in Eng-

land (p. 238). York's remark is there- 
fore quite uncalled for, except in the 
sense of his being two Aienc^ons rolled 
into one — a position which several 
characters occupy in these plays. Even 
then it is more likely Shakespeare had 
in his mind the notorious Alen^on 
(afterwards Henri III.) of the massacre 
at St. Bartholomew's (then Anjou). 
Readers of Dumas will recall his char- 
acter, brought up as he was in the 
Italian school of politics by his mother, 
Catherine de' Medici. The Alen(;on to 
whom Gentillet dedicated his Disconrs 
in 1576 was Francis of Valois, fourth 
son of Catherine. He died at the age 
of thirty in 1584. For an account 
of Machiavel's character as found in 
Elizabethan literature, with an attempt 
to relieve him from the extravagant re- 
probation therein, see Pioneer Human- 
ists, by J. M. Robertson. It is from 
Herr Edward Meyer's book (Weimar, 
1897), who counted 395 references to 
Machiavel,as a monster of wickedness, 
usually. 

84. Strumpet, thy words condemn 
. . . thee] an additional plea. Compare 
Greene, Orlando Furioso (xiii. 188) : — 
"We will, have her punisht by the 

lawes of France, 
To ende her burning lust in flames 

of fire." 
Boswell Stone quotes here from Holin- 
shed (iii. 604): "and yet seeking to 
eetch out life as long as she might, 
stake [stuck] not (though the shift 
were shamefull) to confesse herselfe a 



strumpet, and (unmaried as she was) 
to be with child. For triall, the lord 
regent's lenitie gave hir nine moneths 
stale, at the end wherof she (found here- 
in as false . . .) was thereupon deliuered 
ouer to secular power, and so executed." 

87. sun reflex his beams] This verb 
is not found again in Shakespeare. 
The phrasing is Marlowe's: — 

" For neither rain can fall upon the 
earth, 
Nor sun reflex his virtuous beams 
thereon " 
(Tamburlaine, Part I. in. ii. (20, a), 
1586). One is inclined to give Marlowe 
credit for a good deal of the savagery 
here, such as lies in lines 87-93. 

88. make abode] dwell, live. See 
again Two Gentlemen of Verona, iv. iii. 
23, and King Lear, i. i. 136. Drayton 
uses it in his Heroical Epistles. 

89. darkness . . . death] Malone 
points out that this is scriptural: "to 
give light to them that sit in darkness 
and the shadow oi death." 

89. gloomy] Occurs again only in 
Titus Andronicus, iv. i. 53, and Lu- 
crecc, 803. Another example of the 
many words seemingly deliberately 
dropped out of Shakespeare's later work. 
" Glooming " is in Romeo and Juliet, v. 
iii. 303. Both forms occur in the first 
book of the Faerie Queene : "A little 
glooming light, much like a shade " (i. 
i. 14); "a gloomy glade" (i. vii. 4). 
Peele has "gloomy" several times: 
^'gloomy Time sat whipping on the 
team " {Polyhymnia). And Alcazar, iv.

dronicus, 11. i. 24: "see his shipwreck 
and his commonweal's." The earlier 
and usual expression was " to make

while " suffer shipwreck " occurs liter-

" make shipwracke of her chastitie " in 
Penelopes Web (Grosart, v. 209), 1587. 
And in Sharpham, Cupid's Whirligig,

" make shipwracke violent 
Both of their life and fame."

hO\i\ fruition of her joy." 

"... Absalon may glut his long- 
ing soul 
With sole fruition of his father's

(David and Bethsabe, 478, a). An old, 
but littJe used, word.

William De La Pool, Duke of Suffolk,

"Whereupon" (says Drayton, in his

Because he is near kinsman unto Charles. 45

Where Reignicr sc^oner will receive than give. 
Suf. A dower, my lords ! disgrace not so your king, 

That he should be so abject, base, and poor, 

To choose for wealth and not for perfect love. 50 

Henry is able to enrich his queen. 

And not to seek a queen to make him rich : 

So worthless peasants bargain for their wives, 

As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse. 

Marriage is a matter of more worth 55 

Than to be dealt in by attorneyship : 

Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects, 

Must be companion of his nuptial bed ; 

And therefore, lords, since he affects her most. 

It most of all these reasons bindeth us, 60 

In our opinions she should be preferr'd. 

For what is wedlock forced but a hell, 

An age of discord and continual strife? 

Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss. 

And is a pattern of celestial peace. 65 

Whom should we match with Henry, being a king. 

But Margaret, that is daughter to a king ? 

Her peerless feature, joined with her birth. 

Approves her fit for none but for a king :

KING HENRY THE SIXTH

Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit, 70 

More than in women commonly is seen, 
Will answer our hope in issue of a king ; 
For Henry, son unto a conqueror. 
Is likely to beget more conquerors, 

If with a lady of so high resolve 75 

As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love. 
Then yield, my lords ; and here conclude with me 
That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she. 
K. Hen. Whether it be through force of j-our report. 

My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that 80 

My tender \-outh was never yet attaint 

With any passion of inflaming love, 

I cannot tell ; but this I am assur'd, 

I feel such sharp dissension in my breast, 

Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear, 85 

As I am sick with working of my thoughts. 

Take, therefore, shipping ; post, my lord, to France ; 

Agree to any covenants, and procure 

That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come 

To cross the seas to England and be crown'd 90 

King Henry's faithful and anointed queen. 

For your expenses and sufficient charge. 

Among the people gather up a tenth. 



70. undaunted] This is the third occur- 
rence of " undaunted spirit " (i. i. 127 ; iii. 
ii. 99). Only again in Macbeth. With 
regard to this description of Margaret, 
compare Grafton, p. 625 (The XXI I J 
Yere) : " This woman excelled all other, 
as well in beautie and favour, as in uyt 
and pollicie, and was of stomacke and 
courage, more lyke to a man then a 
woman " (see line 71). See note at i. i. 
127. Probably in one of the Chronicles. 

76. link'd] similarly used in 3 Henry 
VI. IV. ii. 116 (" link'd in friendship") ; 
and in Antony and Cleopatra, i. ii. 193. 
Compare Greene, yames the Fourth (xiii. 
269) : " love, the faithfuU lincke of loyall 
hearts." An alliterative touch. 

78. none but she] recalls Marlowe's 
" And none but thou shall be my para- 
mour " (Fausfus, ed. Dyce, p. 100, a). 

81. attaint] attainted, infected. See 

"taint" above, v. iii. 183. Compare 

Golding's Ovid, xiv. 68 : " she sawe 

her hinderloynes with barking buggs 

aiteint." And Peele, Sir Clyomon : — 

" my heart to fight doth faint. 

Therefore He take me to my legs, 

seeing my honour I must attaint " 

(531, b). And Spenser, Faerie Queene, i. 



vii. 34 : " Phoebus golden face it did 
attaint." See note at attainted, 11. iv. 
96 above. 

86. working of my thoughts] Malone 
refers to Henry V. iii. Prol. 25. Shake- 
speare constantly applies the verb " to 
the motions or labours of the mind" 
(Schmidt). 

87. Take . . . shipping] A recognised 
expression. Compare Lyly, The Woman 
in the Moone, iv. i. (circa 1510 ?) : " tell 
me which way shall we go ? Pandora. 
Unto the sea-side, and take shipping 
streight." And in The Queen's Enter- 
tainment at Rycot (Nichols' Progresses, 
iii. 170), 1592: "Being readie to take 
shipping." 

88. procure] contrive. 

93. gather up a tenth] This is wTong. 
" The king had with her not one pennie, 
and for the fetchyng of her, the Marques 
of Suffolke demaunded a whole fiftene 
in open Parliament " (Grafton, p. 625). 
But it is correctly announced in '2 Henry 
VI. I. i. 133. And in Drayton, England's 
Heroical Epistles : " A fifteen's tax in 
France I freely spent In triumphs." 
But this belongs to another stor>-. 



160 KING HENRY THE SIXTH [act v. sc. v. 



Be gone, I say ; for till you do return 

I rest perplexed with a thousand cares. 

And you, good uncle, banish all offence : 

If you do censure me by what you were, 

Not what you are, I know it will excuse 

This sudden execution of my will. 

And so conduct me, where from company 

I may revolv^e and ruminate my grief. 
Glou. Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last. 

[E.vcunt Gloucester and Exeter. 
Suf. Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd ; and thus he goes. 

As did the youthful Paris once to Greece ; 

With hope to find the like event in love, 

But prosper better than the Trojan did. 

Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king ; 

But I will rule both her, the king, and realm.

l^Exit. 



105 



[Exit. 



102. Exeunt . . .] Capell ; Exit Gloucester Ff. 



97. cens«r£] judge, criticise, 
loi. revolve and ruminate] Occurs 
again in Troilus and Cressida, 11. iii. 
198: "revolve and ruminate himself." 
Oftener without than with "on" in 
Shakespeare. Compare Greene, Orlando 
Furioso (xiii. 140) : " There solemnely he 
ruminates his loue." 

104. Paris once to Greece] Greene 
never wearies of Paris ; he has him (or 
Helen) in ever}-- place and tract : — 

" Should Paris enter in the courts of 
Greece, 
And not lie fettered in faire Hellens 
lookes? " 



{Flier Bacon (xiii. S3)). In this scene, 
like several others, Shakespeare seems to 
disappear towards the end as though he 
wearied of the task of revi\'ifying and re- 
modelling. We see nevertheless evidence 
of his work in several turns of language. 
105. event] result, consequence— a 
common use in Shakespeare. " I '11 after 
him, and see the event of this " {Taming 
of the Shrew, 111. n. 129), and above, iv. i. 
191 — in every play perhaps. The word 
is not commonly met with so early. 
Lyly has it in Sapho and Phao (1584) 
v. i. : "I will expect the event and tarye 
for Cupid."
