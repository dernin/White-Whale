The room is lunurtously and artistically Jurnished. 
The sound 0/ a piano ts heard m the adjoining 
room. 

[lane is arratigzng afternoon, tea on the tnhle, and 
after the music haj, ceased, Algernon wtierj,] 

ALGERNON 

Did you heai wlut 1 was playing, Lane? 

LANE 

I didn’t think it polite to listen, sir. 

ALGERNON 

I’m sorry for that, for your sake. I don't 
play accurately — any one can play accurately — 
but I play with wonderful expression As far 
as the piano is concerned, sentiment is ray forte. 
I keep science for Life.

Yes, sir. [Ha«di them on a salver ]

[/fi.^eci^ them, takes imo, and sits down on the

your book that on Thuisday night, when Lord 
Shoreman and Mr Worthing were dimng with 
me, eight bottles of champagne are entered as 
having been consumed 

LANE 

Yes, sir ; eight hotties and a pnit, 

ALGERNON 

Why IS it that at a bachelor’s establishment 
the servants invariably drink the champagne? 

I ask merely for information 



I.] IMFOKTANCE OF BEING EARNEST & 

I attribute it to the superior quality of the 
winej sir. I have often observed, that in maiiied 
households ihe champagne is rarely of a first-rate 
branil 

ALGERNON 

Good heavens ' Is mariiage so demoialising 
as that ^ 

LANE 

I believe it a very pleasant state, sir I have 
had very little experience of it myself up to the 
present I have only been married once That 
was in consequence of a misundeistanding 
between myself and a young person. 

ALGERNON 

[Languidly ] I don’t know that I am much 
inteiested in your family life. Lane

No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject, 
I never think of it myself.

thank you.

Thank you. Sir. [lane goes out.'\ 

ALGEENON 

Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax 
Really, if the lower oitlers don't set us a good 
example, what on earth is the use of rhem? 
They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense 
of moral responsibility.

JAC* 

May I ask why ? 

ALGERNON 

My deal fellow, the way you flirt with Gwen- 
dolen is perfectly disgraceful It is almost as 
bad as the way Gwendolen fluts with you. 

JACK 

I am in love with Gwendolen. I have come 
up to town expressly to propose to her 

ALGERNON 

I thought you had come up for pleasure.^ . . . 
I call that business. 

JACK 

How ut telly unromantic you are ’ 

ALGERNON 

I really don't see anything romantic in pro- 
posing It is very romantic to be in love But 
there is nothing lomaiitic about a definite pro- 
posal. Why, one may be accepted. One usually 
is, I believe. Then the excitement is all over. 
The very essence of romance is uncertainty. If

That IS quite a different matter She is my

Gwendolen. Gwendolen is devoted to bread

ALGERNON 

Wellj my dear fellow, you need not eat as if 
you were going to eat it all. You behave as if 
you were married to her already You are not 
married to her already, and I don’t think you 
ever will be. 

JACK 

Why on earth do you say that ^ 

ALC5ERN0N 

Well, in the first place girls never marry the 
men they flirt with. Guls don’t think it right. 

JACK 

Oh, that IS nonsense ! 

ALGERNON 

It isn’t. It IS a great truth. It accounts for 
the extraordinary number of bachelors that one 
sees all over the place. In the second place, I 
don’t give my consent.

Oh ! it IS absurd to have a hard and fast rule 
about what one should read and what one 
shouldn’t More than half of modern cultuie 
depends on what one shouldn’t read

old boy, you had much better have the thing

JACK 

My dear Algy, you talk exactly as if you were 
a dentist It is very vulgar to tallt like a dentist 
when one isn’t a dentist. It produces a false 
impression 

ALGERNON 

Well, that IS exactly what dentists always do. 
Now, go on ’ Tell me the whole thing I may 
mention that I have alw'ays suspected you of 
being a confirmed and secret Bunbujyist, and I

My dear fellow, there is nothing improbable 
about my explanation at all. In fact it’s per- 
fectly ordinary. Old Mr Thomas Cardew, who 
adopted me when I was a httle boy, made me 
in his will guardian to his grand-dau ghter. Miss 
Cecily Cardew. Cecily, who addresses me 'as

her uncle from motives of respect that you 
could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place 
in the country under the charge of her admirable 
governess. Miss Prism 

ALGERNON 

Where is that place in the country, by the 
way? 

JACK. 

That IS nothing to you, dear hoy You are 
not going to be invited. . I may tell you 
candidly that the place is not in Sliropshire. 

ALGERNON 

I suspected that, my dear fellow ' I have 
Bunburyed all over Shropshire on two separate 
occasions. Now, go on Why are you Ernest 
in town and Jack m the country? 

JACK 

My dear Algy, I don’t know whether you 
will be able to understand ray leal motives 
You are hardly serious enough. When one is 
placed in the position of guardian, one has to 



18 IMPORTANCE OP BEING EARNEST [;(ot 


adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects. 
It’s one’s duty to do so. And as a high moral 
tone can hardly be said to conduce very much 
to either one’s health or one’s iiappiness^ in 
order to get up to town I have always pre- 
tended to have a younger brother of the name 
of Ernest, who lives in the Albany, and gets 
into the most dreadful scrapes That, my dear 
Algy, is the wdiole truth pure and simple. 

ALGERNON 

The truth is rarely pure and never simple. 
Modern life would be very tedious if it were 
either, and modern literature a complete im- 
possibility ' 

JACK 

That wouldn’t be at all a had thinir. 

ALGERNON 

Literary criticism is not your foite, my 
dear fellow, Bon’t try it You should leave 
that to people who haven’t been at a 
University They do it so well in the daily 
papers What you really are is a Bunburyist. 



I ] IMPOllTANCE OP BEING EARNEST 19 

I was quite right in saying you were a Bun- 
buryist You are one of the most advanced 
Bunburyists I know. 

JACK 

What on earth do you mean? 

ALGERNON 

You have invented a very useful younger 
brother called Ernest, m order that you may 
be able to come up to town as often as you 
like. I have invented an invaluable permanent 
invalid called Banbury, m order that I may 
be able to go down into the country whenever 
I choose Bunbury is perfectly invaluable. If 
it wasn’t for Bunbury’s extraordinary bad health, 
for instance, I wouldn’t be able to dme with 
you at Willis’s to-night, for I have been really 
engaged to Aunt Augusta for more than a 
week. 

JACK 

I haven’t asked you to dine with me any- 
where to-mght. 



20 LMPOHTjiKCE OE EE1N& EAJiNEST [act

I know. You are absurdly careless about 
sending out imitations. It is very- foolish of 
you. Nothing annoys people so much as not 
receiving imitations. 

JACK 

You had much better dine with your Aunt 
Augusta 

ALOERN'ON 

I haven’t the smallest intention of doing 
anything of the kind To begin with, I dined 
there on Monday, and once a week is quite 
enough to dine with one’s own relations. In the 
second place, whenever I do dme there I am 
always treated as a member of the family, and 
sent down with either no wom.in at all, or two 
In the third place, I know peifectly well 
whom she will place me next to, to-night. She 
will place me next Mary Farquhar, who always 
flirts with her own husband across the dinner- 
table That IS not very pleasant. Indeed, it 
is not even decent ... and that sort of thing 



I.] IMrORTANCE OP BEING EARNEST 21 


IS *1 enormously on the increase. The amount 
of women in London who dirt with thesr own 
husbands is perfectly scandalous It looks so 
bad. It is simply washing one's clean linen m 
public. BesideSj now that I know you to be 
a confirmed Bunburyist I naturally want to 
talk to you about Bunhurying I want to tell 
you the rules 

lACK 

I ’m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen 
accepts me, I am going to kill my brother, 
indeed I think I '11 kill him m any case. Cecily 
- IS a little too much interested m him. It is 
rathei a boie So I am going to get nd of 
Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the 
same with Mr . . with your invalid friend who 
has the absurd name. 

ALGERNON 

Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbnry, 
and if you ever get married, which seems to 
me extremely problematic, you will be very 
glad to know Bnnbury. A man who marries

IS the theory that the corrupt French Drama

if you would ask Mr. Banbury, from me, to 
be kind enough not to have a relapse on 
Saturday, for I rely on you to arrange my music 
for me. It is my last leception, and one wants 
something that will encourage conversation, 
particularly at the end of the season when 
every one has practically said whatever they 
had to say, which, in. most cases, was probably 
not much

ITi speak to Banbury, Aunt Augusta, if he 
is still conscious, and I think I can promise 
you he’ll be all right by Saturday. Of course 
idle music is a great difficulty You see, if one 
plays good music, people don’t listen, and if 
one play^ bad music people don’t talk. But

That is satisfactory. What between the

or not. seems to me to display a contempt for 
the ordinary decencies of family life that reminds 
one of the woist excesses of the Fiench Revolu- 
tion And I presume you know what that 
unfortunate movement led to? As for the 
paiticular locality in which the hand-bag was 
found, a cloak-room at a railway station might 
serve to conceal a social indiscretion — has 
probably, indeed, been used for that purpose 
before now — but it could hardly be regarded 
as an assured basis for a recognised position 
in good society,

I suppose that is why he often looks a little 
bored when we three are together.

MISS PRIS-M 

jCeci %' ' r am surprised at you. Mr. Worthing 
has many troubles in his life Idle merrimeni 
and tnviality would be out of place in his con- 
versation. You must lemember his constant 
anxiety about that unfoitaaate young man his 
brother. 

CBCIUY 

I wish Uncle Jack would allow that unfortunate 
young maUj Ins brother^ to come down here 
sometimes We might have a good influence 
over hiiH) Miss Prism. I am sure you certamly 
would. You know German, and geology, and 
things of that kind influence a man very much.

Yes, but It usually chronicles the things that
