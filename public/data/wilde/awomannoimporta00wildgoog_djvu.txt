A WOMAN OF NO IMPORTANCE 



FIRST ACT 



Scene — Lawn in front of terrace at Hun- 
stanton. 

\Sir fohn and Lady Caroline Pontefracty Miss 
Worsley^ on chairs under large yew tree.'\ 

LADY CAROLINE 

I believe this is the first English country house 
you have stayed at, Miss Worsley ? 

HESTER 

Yes, Lady Caroline. 

LADY CAROLINE 

You have no country houses, I am told, in 
America ? 

HESTER 

We have not many. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Have you any country? What we should call 
country ? 



HESTER 

[Smtltn^^,] We have the largest country in the 
world, Lady Caroline. They used to tell us at 
school that some of our states are as big as 
France and England put together. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Ah ! you must find it very draughty, I should 
fancy. [To Sir foAn.] John, you should have 
your muffler. What is the use of my always 
knitting mufflers for you if you won't wear them ? 

SIR JOHN 

I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I think not, John. Well, you couldn't come 
to a more charming place than this. Miss Worsley, 
though the house is excessively damp, quite un- 
pardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is 
sometimes a little lax about the people she asks 
down here. [To Sir /oAn,] Jane mixes too 
much. Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of 
high distinction. It is a privilege to meet him. 
And that member of Parliament, Mr. Kettle 

SIR JOHN 

Kelvil, my love, Kelvil. 

LADY CAROLINE 

He must be quite respectable. One has never 

z 



heard his name before in the whole course of 
one's life, which speaks volumes for a man now- 
a-days. But Mrs. Allonby is hardly a very suit- 
able person. 



HESTER 

I dislike Mrs. Allonby. I dislike her more 
than I can say. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I am not sure, Miss Worsley, that foreigners 
like yourself should cultivate likes or dislikes 
about the people they are invited to meet. Mrs. 
Allonby is very well born. She is a niece of 
Lord Brancaster's. It is said, of course, that she 
ran away twice before she was married. But you 
know how unfair people often are. I myself don't 
believe she ran away more than once. 

HESTER 

Mr. Arbuthnot is very charming. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Ah, yes ! the young man who has a post in a 
bank. Lady Hunstanton is most kind in asking 
him here, and Lord Illingworth seems to have 
taken quite a fancy to him. I am not sure, how- 
ever, that Jane is right in taking him out of his 
position. In my young days. Miss Worsley, 
one never met any one in society who worked 
for their living. It was not considered the thing. 

3 



HESTER 

In America those are the people we respect 
most. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I have no doubt of iL 

HESTER 

Mr. Arbuthnot has a beautiful nature! He is 
so simple, so sincere. He has one of the most 
beautiful natures I have ever come across. It 
is a privilege to meet khm. 

m 

LADY CAROLINE 

It is not customary in England, Miss WcM^Iey, 
for a young lady to speak with such enthusiasm 
of any person of the opposite sex. English 
women conceal their feelings till after they are 
married. They show them then. 

HESTER 

Do you, in England, allow no friendship to 
exist between a young man and a young girl ? 

[Enter Lady Hunstanton^ followed by Footman 
with shawls and a cushion^ 

LADY CAROLINE 

We think it very inadvisable. Jane, I was just 
saying what a pleasant party you have asked us 
to meet You have a wonderful power of selec- 
tion. It is quite a gift. 

4 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

Dear Caroline, how kind of you ! I think we 
all do fit in very nicely together. And I hope 
our charming American visitor will carry back 
pleasant recollections of our English country life. 
[To Footman,] The cushion there, Francis. And 
my shawl. The Shetland. Get the Shetland. 

[Exit Footman for shawl^ 

[Enter Gerald Arbuthnof] 

GERALD 

Lady Hunstanton, I have such good news to 
tell you. Lord Illingworth has just offered to 
make me his secretary. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

His secretary? That is good news, indeed, 
Gerald. It means a very brilliant future in store 
for you. Your dear mother will be delighted. I 
really must try and induce her to come up here 
to-night. Do you think she would, Gerald ? I 
know how difficult it is to get her to go any- 
where. 

GERALD 

Oh ! I am sure she would, Lady Hunstanton, 
if she knew Lord Illingworth had made me such 
an offer. 

[Enter Footman with shawl,'] 

5 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

I will write and tell her about it, and ask her 
to come up and meet him. [To Foolman,] Just 
wait, Francis. [ Writes letter,'] 

LADY CAROLINE 

That is a very wonderful opening for so young 
a man as you are, Mr. Arbuthnot. 

GERALD 

It is, indeed, Lady Caroline. I trust I shall 
be able to show myself worthy of it. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I trust so. 

GERALD 

[To Hester^ You have not congratulated me 
yet. Miss Worsley. 

HESTER 

Are you pleased about it ? 

GERALD 

Of course I am. It means everything to me — 
things that were out of the reach of hope before 
may be within hope's reach now. 

HESTER 

Nothing should be out of the reach of hope. 
Life is a hope. 

6 



LADY HUNSTANTON 



I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord 
Illingworth is aiming at. I heard that he was 
offered Vienna. But that may not be true. 



LADY CAROLINE 

I don't think that England should be repre- 
sented abroad by an unmarried man, Jane. It 
might lead to complications. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

You are too nervous, Caroline. Believe me, 
you are too nervous. Besides, Lord Illingworth 
may marry any day. I was in hopes he would 
have married Lady Kelso. But I believe he said 
her family was too large. Or was it her feet? 
I forget which. I regret it very much. She was 
made to be an ambassador's wife. 

LADY CAROLINE 

She certainly has a wonderful faculty of remem- 
bering people's names and forgetting their faces. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Well that is very natural, Caroline, is it not? 
[To Fooiman,] Tell Henry to wait for an answer. 
I have written a line to your dear mother, Gerald, 
to tell her your good news, and to say she really 
must come to dinner. 

[Exit Footman.] 

7 



GERALD 

That is awfully kind of you, Lady Hunstanton. 
[To Hester,"] Will you come for a stroll, Miss 
Worsley ? 

HESTER 

With pleasure. 

[Exit with Gerald^ 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

I am very much gratified at Gerald Arbuthnot's 
good fortune. He is quite a protigi of mine. 
And I am particularly pleased that Lord IlHng- 
worth should have made the offer of his own 
accord without my suggesting anything. Nobody 
likes to be asked favours. I remember poor 
Charlotte Pagden making herself quite unpopular 
one season, because she had a French governess 
she wanted to recommend to every one. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I saw the governess, Jane. Lady Pagden sent 
her to me. It was before Eleanor came out. She 
was far too good-looking to be in any respectable 
household. I don't wonder. I don't wonder Lady 
Pagden was so anxious to get rid of her. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah ! that explains it 

LADY CAROLINE 

John, the grass is too damp for you. You 

8 



had better go and put on your overshoes at 
once. 

SIR JOHN 

I am quite comfortable, Caroline, I assure you. 

LADY CAROLINE 

You must allow me to be the best judge of that, 
John. Pray do as I tell you. 

[Sir John gets up and goes off."] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

You Spoil him, Caroline, you do indeed ! 

[Enter Mrs. Allonby and Lady Stutfield,'] 

[To Mrs, Allonby.'] Well, dear, I hope you like 
the park. It is said to be well timbered. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

The trees are wonderful, Lady Hunstanton. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Quite, quite wonderful. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

But somehow I feel sure that if I lived in the 
country for six months I should become so un- 
sophisticated that no one would take the slightest 
notice of me. 

9 c 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

I assure you, dear, that the country has not 
that effect at all. Why, it was from Welthorpe, 
which is only two miles from here, that Lady 
Belton eloped with Lord Fethersdale. I re- 
member the occurrence perfectly. Poor Lord 
Belton died three days afterwards of joy, or gout. 
I forget which. We had a large party staying 
here at the time, so we were all very much in- 
terested in the whole affair. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I think to elope is cowardly. It's running away 
from danger. And danger has become so rare in 
modern life. 

LADY CAROLINE 

As far as I can make out, the young women 
of the present day seem to make it the sole 
object of their lives to be always playing with 
fire. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

The one advantage of playing with fire, Lady 
Caroline, is that one never gets even singed. It 
is the people who don't know how to play with 
it who get burned up. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes ; I see that. It is very, very helpful. 

lO 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

I don't know how the world would get on with 
such a theory as that, dear Mrs. Allonby. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Ah ! the world was made for men and not for 
women. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh, don't say that, Lady Stutfield. We have 
a much better time than they have. There are 
far more things forbidden to us than are for- 
bidden to them. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes; that is quite, quite true. I had not 
thought of that. 

[Enter Sir John and Mr, KelviLI 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Well, Mr. Kelvil, have you got through your 
work? 

KELVIL 

I have finished my writing for the day. Lady 
Hunstanton. It has been an arduous task. The 
demands on the time of a public man are very 
heavy, now-a-days, very heavy indeed. And I 
don't think they meet with adequate recognition. 



LADY CAROLINE 

John, have you got your overshoes on ? 

SIR JOHN 

Yes, my love. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I think you had better come over here, John. 
It is more sheltered: 

SIR JOHN 

I am quite comfortable, Caroline. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I think not, John. You had better sit beside 
me. [Sir John rises and goes across^ 

LADY STUTFIELD 

And what have you been writing about this 
morning, Mr. Kelvil ? 

KELVIL 

On the usual subject, Lady Stutfield. On 
Purity. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

That must be such a very, very interesting 
thing to write about 

\2 



KELVIL 

It is the one subject of really national import- 
ance now-a-days, Lady Stutfield. I purpose 
addressing my constituents on the question before 
Parliament meets. I find that the poorer classes 
of this country display a marked desire for a 
higher ethical standard. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

How quite, quite nice of them. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Are you in favour of women taking part in 
politics, Mr. Kettle ? 

SIR JOHN 

Kelvil, my love, Kelvil. 

KELVIL 

The growing influence of women is the one 
re-assuring thing in our political life. Lady Caro- 
line. Women are always on the side of morality, 
public and private. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

It is SO very, very gratifying to hear you say 
that 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, yes! the moral qualities In women — that 

13 



is the important thing. I am afraid, Caroline, 
that dear Lord Illing^orth doesn't value the 
moral qualities in women as much as he should. 

[Enter Lord lUingworth^ 

LADY STUTFIELD 

The world says that Lord Illing^orth is very, 
very wicked. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

But what world says that. Lady Stutfield ? It 
must be the next world. This world and I are 
on excellent terms. \Sits down beside Mrs, 
Allonby.'] 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Every one / know says you are very, very 
wicked. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is perfectly monstrous the way people go 
about, now-a-days, saying things against one 
behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely 
true. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Dear Lord lUingworth is quite hopeless, Lady 
Stutfield. I have given up trying to reform him. 
It would take a Public Company with a Board 
of Directors and a paid Secretary to do that 

14 



But you have the secretary already, Lord Illing- 
worth, haven't you ? Gerald Arbuthnot has told 
us of his good fortune ; it is really most kind 
of you. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Oh, don't say that, Lady Hunstanton. Kind 
is a dreadful word. I took a great fancy to young 
Arbuthnot the moment I met him, and he'll be 
of considerable use to me in something I am 
foolish enough to think of doing. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

He is an admirable young man. And his 
mother is one of my dearest friends. He has 
just gone for a walk with our pretty American. 
She is very pretty, is she not ? 

LADY CAROLINE 

Far too pretty. These American girls carry 
off all the good matches. Why can't they stay 
in their own country? They are always telling 
us it is the Paradise of women. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is. Lady Caroline. That is why, like Eve, 
they are so extremely anxious to get out of it. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Who are Miss Worsley's parents ? 

15 



am told. They certainly are in England. Dear 
Mr. Cardew is ruining the country. I wonder 
Mrs. Cardew allows him. I am sure, Lord 
Illingworth, you don't think that uneducated 
people should be allowed to have votes? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I think they are the only people who should. 

KELVIL 

Do you take no side, then, in modern politics. 
Lord Illingworth? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

One should never take sides in anything, Mr. 
Kelvil. Taking sides is the beginning of sincerity, 
and earnestness follows shortly afterwards, and 
the human being becomes a bore. However, the 
House of Commons really does very little harm. 
You can't make people good by Act of Parlia- 
ment, — that is something. 

KELVIL 

You cannot deny that the House of Commons 
has always shown great sympathy with the suffer- 
ings of the poor. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

That is its special vice. That is the special 
vice of the age. One should sympathise with the 

x8 



joy, the beauty, the colour of life. The less said 
about life's sores the better, Mr. Kelvil. 

KELVIL 

Still our East End is a very important problem. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Quite so. It is the problem of slavery. And 
we are trying to solve it by amusing the slaves. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Certainly a great deal may be done by means 
of cheap entertainments, as you say. Lord Illing- 
worth. Dear - Dr. Daubeney, our rector here, 
provides, with the assistance of his curates, really 
admirable recreations for the poor during the 
winter. And much good may be done by means 
of a magic lantern, or a missionary, or some 
popular amusement of that kind. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I am not at all in favour of amusements for 
the poor, Jane. Blankets and coals are sufficient. 
There is too much love of pleasure amongst the 
upper classes as it is. Health is what we want 
in modern life. The tone is not healthy, not 
healthy at all. 

KELVIL 

You are quite right. Lady Caroline. 

19 



LADY CAROLINE 

I believe I am usually right. 

MRS. ALLONBV 

Horrid word * health.' 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Silliest word in our language, and one knows 
so well the popular idea of health. The English 
country gentleman galloping after a fox — the 
unspeakable in pursuit of the uneatable. 

KELVIL 

May I ask, Lord Illingworth, if you regard 
the House of Lords as a better institution than 
the House of Commons ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

A much better institution, of course. We in 
the House of Lords are never in touch with public 
opinion. That makes us a civilised body. 

KELVIL 

Are you serious in putting forward such a 
view? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Quite serious, Mr. Kelvil. [To Mrs. Allonby,'\ 

20 



Vulgar habit that is people have, now-a-days, of 
asking one, after one has given them an idea, 
whether one is serious or not Nothing is serious 
except passion. The intellect is not a serious 
thing, and never has been. It is an instrument 
on which one plays, that is all. The only serious 
form of intellect I know is the British intellect. 
And on the British intellect the illiterate play 
the drum. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

What are you saying. Lord Illingworth, about 
the drum ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I was merely talking to Mrs. AUonby about the 
leading articles in the London newspapers. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

But do you believe all that is written in the 
newspapers ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I do. Now-a-days it is only the unreadable 
that occurs. [Rises with Mrs. Allonby,'\ 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Are you going, Mrs. Allonby ? 

21 



MRS. ALLONBY 

Just as far as the conservatory. Lord Illing- 
worth told me, this morning, that there was an 
orchid there as beautiful as the seven deadly sins. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear, I hope there is nothing of the kind. 
I will certainly speak to the gardener. 

[Exit Mrs, Allonby and Lord Illingworth,'\ 

LADY CAROLINE 

Remarkable type, Mrs. Allonby. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

She lets her clever tongue run away with her 
sometimes. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Is that the only thing, Jane, Mrs. Allonby allows 
to run away with her ? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

I hope so, Caroline, I am sure. 

[Enter Lord Alfred^ 

Dear Lord Alfred, do join us. [Lord Alfred sits 
down beside Lady Stutfield^ 

LADY CAROLINE 

You believe good of every one, Jane. It is a 
great fault. 

22 



LADY STUTFIELD 



Do you really, really think, Lady Caroline, that 
one should believe evil of every one ? 



LADY CAROLINE 

I think it is much safer to do so. Lady Stut- 
field. Until, of course, people are found out to 
be good. But that requires a great deal of 
imagination, now-a-days. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

But there is so much unkind scandal in modern 
life. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Lord Illingworth remarked to me last night 
at dinner that the basis of every scandal is an 
absolutely immoral certainty. 

KELVIL 

Lord Illingworth is, of course, a very brilliant 
man, but he seems to me to be lacking in that 
fine faith in the nobility and purity of life which 
is so important in this century. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes, quite, quite important, is it not ? 

KELVIL 

He gives me the impression of a man who does 

23 



not appreciate the beauty of our English home- 
life. I would say that he is tainted with foreign 
ideas on the subject. 



LADY STUTFIELD 



There is nothing, nothing like the beauty of 
home-life, is there ? 

KELVIL 

It is the mainstay of our moral system in 
England, Lady Stutfield. Without it we would 
become like our neighbours. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

That would be so, so sad, would it not ? 

KELVIL 

I am afraid, too, that Lord Illingworth regards 
woman simply as a toy. Now I have never 
regarded woman as a toy. Woman is the intel- 
lectual helpmeet of man in public as in private 
life. Without her we should forget the true ideals. 
[Sits down beside Lady Stutfield^ 

LADY STUTFIELD 

I am so very, very glad to hear you say that. 

LADY CAROLINE 

You a married man, Mr. Kettle ? 

24 



SIR JOHN 

Kelvil, dear, Kelvil. 

KELVIL 

I am married, Lady Caroline. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Family ? 

KELVIL 

Yes. 

LADY CAROLINE 

How many ? 

KELVIL 

Eight. 

[Lady Stutfield turns her attention to Lord 
Alfred.] 

LADY CAROLINE 

Mrs. Kettle and the children are, I suppose, at 
the seaside? \Sir John shrugs his shoulders^ 

KELVIL 

My wife is at the seaside with the children. 
Lady Caroline. 

LADY CAROLINE 

You will join them later on, no doubt ? 

25 E 



KELVIL 

If my public engagements permit me. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Your public life must be a great source of grati- 
fication to Mrs. Kettle. 

SIR JOHN 

Kelvil, my love, Kelvil. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

[To Lord Alfred^ How very, very charming 
those gold-tipped cigarettes of yours are, Lord 
Alfred. 

LORD ALFRED 

They are awfully expensive. I can only afford 
them when I'm in debt. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

It must be terribly, terribly distressing to be 
in debt. 

LORD ALFRED 

One must have some occupation now-a-days. 
If I hadn't my debts I shouldn't have anything 
to think about. All the chaps I know are in 
debt 

LADY STUTFIELD 

But don't the people to whpm you owe the 

26 



money give you a great, great deal of annoy- 
ance? 

[Enter Footman,'] 

LORD ALFRED 

Oh, no, they write ; I don't. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

How very, very strange. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, here is a letter, Caroline, from dear Mrs. 
Arbuthnot. She won't dine. I am so sorry. But 
she will come in the evening. I am very pleased, 
indeed. She is one of the sweetest of women. 
Writes a beautiful hand, too, so large, so firm. 
[Hands letter to Lady Caroline^ 

LADY CAROLINE 

[Looking at it.] A little lacking in femininity, 
Jane. Femininity is the quality I admire most 
in women. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

[Taking back letter and leaving it on table.] Oh ! 
she is very feminine, Caroline, and so good, too. 
You should hear what the Archdeacon says of 
her. He regards her as his right hand in the 
parish. [Footman speaks to her!] In the Yellow 
Drawing-room. Shall we all go in ? Lady Stut- 
field, shall we go in to tea ? 

27 



LADY STUTFIELD 



With pleasure, Lady Hunstanton. [They rise 
and proceed to go off. Sir John offers to carry 
Lady StutfieUTs cloak.] 

LADY CAROLINE 

John ! If you would allow your nephew to look 
after Lady Stutfield's cloak, you might help me 
with my work basket. 

[Enter Lord Illingworth and Mrs. Allondy.] 

SIR JOHN 

Certainly, my love. 

[Exeunt.] 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Curious thing, plain women are always jealous 
of their husbands, beautiful women never are ! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Beautiful women never have time. They are 
always so occupied in being jealous of other 
people's husbands. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I should have thought Lady Caroline would 
have grown tired of conjugal anxiety by this 
time ! Sir John is her fourth ! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

So much marriage is certainly not becoming. 

2i 



Twenty years of romance make a woman look 
like a ruin ; but twenty years of marriage make 
her something like a public building. 



MRS. ALLONBY 



Twenty years of romance. Is there such a 
thing? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Not in our day. Women have become too 
brilliant. Nothing spoils a romance so much as 
a sense of humour in the woman. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Or the want of it in the man. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You are quite right. In a Temple every one 
should be serious except the thing that is 
worshipped. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

And that should be man ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Women kneel so gracefully ; men don't. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

You are thinking of Lady Stutfield ! 

29 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I assure you I have not thought of Lady 
Stutfield for the last quarter of an hour. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Is she such a mystery ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

She is more than a mystery — she is a mood. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Moods don't last. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is their chief charm. 
[Enter Hester and Gerald^ 

GERALD 

Lord Illingworth, every one has been congratu- 
lating me, Lady Hunstanton and Lady Caroline, 
and . . . every one. I hope I shall make a good 
secretary. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You will be the pattern secretary, Gerald* 
\Talks to him.] 

MRS. ALLONBY 

You enjoy country life. Miss Worsley ? 

30 



HESTER 

Very much indeed. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Don't find yourself longing for a London dinner- 
table ? 

HESTER 

I dislike London dinner-parties. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I adore them. The clever people never listen, 
and the stupid people never talk. 

HESTER 

I think the stupid people talk a great deal. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Ah, I never listen ! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

My dear boy, if I didn't like you I wouldn't 
have made you the offer. It is because I like 
you so much that I want to have you with me. 

[Exit Hester with Gerald,'] 
Charming fellow, Gerald Arbuthnot ! 

MRS. ALLONBY 

He is very nice ; very nice indeed. But I can't 
stand the American young lady. 

31 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Why? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

She told me yesterday, and in quite a loud 
voice too, that she was only eighteen. It was 
most annoying. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

One should never trust a woman who tells one 
her real age. A woman who would tell one that, 
would tell one anything. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

She is a Puritan, besides 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 



Ah, that is inexcusable. I don't mind plain 
women being Puritans. It is the only excuse 
they have for being plain. But she is decidedly 
pretty. I admire her immensely. [Looks stead- 
fastly at Mrs. Allonby^ 

MRS. ALLONBY 

What a thoroughly bad man you must be ! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What do you call a bad man ? 

32 



MRS. ALLONBY 

The sort of man who admires innocence. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

And a bad woman ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh ! the sort of woman a man never gets tired 
of. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You are severe — on yourself. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Define us as a sex. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Sphinxes without secrets. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Does that include the Puritan women ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Do you know I don't believe in the existence 
of Puritan women ? I don't think there is a 
woman in the world who would not be a little 
flattered if one made love to her. It is that 
which makes women so irresistibly adorable. 

33 f 



MRS. ALLONBY 

You think there Is no woman in the world who 
would object to being kissed ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Very few. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Miss Worsley would not let you kiss her. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Are you sure ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Quite. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What do you think she'd do if I kissed her ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Either marry you, or strike you across the face 
with her glove. What would you do if she struck 
you across the face with her glove ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Fall in love with her, probably. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Then it is lucky you are not going to kiss her i 

34 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Is that a challenge ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

It is an arrow shot into the air. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Don't you know that I always succeed in what- 
ever I try ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I am sorry to hear it We women adore 
failures. They lean on us. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You worship successes. You cling to them. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

We are the laurels to hide their baldness. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

And they need you always, except at the 
moment of triumph. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

They are uninteresting then. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

How tantalising you are ! [A pause,] 

35 



MRS. ALLONBY 



Lord Illingworth, there is one thing I shall 
always like you for. 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 



Only one thing? And I have so many bad 
qualities. 



MRS. ALLONBY 



Ah, don't be too conceited about them. You 
may lose them as you grow old. 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 



I never intend to grow old. The soul is born 
old but grows young. That is the comedy of life. 



MRS. ALLONBY 



And the body is bom young but grows old. 
That is life's tragedy. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It's comedy also, sometimes. But what is the 
mysterious reason why you will always like me ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

It is that you have never made love to me. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I have never done anything else. 

36 



MRS. ALLONBY 

Really ? I have not noticed it. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

How fortunate ! It might have been a tragedy 
for both of us. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

We should each have survived. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

One can survive everything now-a-days, except 
death, and live down anything except a good 
reputation. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Have you tried a good reputation ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is one of the annoyances to which I have 
never been subjected. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

It may come. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Why do you threaten me ? 

37 



MRS. ALLONBY 

I will tell you when you have kissed the Puritan. 
[Enter Footman.] 

FRANCIS 

Tea is served in the Yellow Drawing-room, my 
lord. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Tell her ladyship we are coming in. 

FRANCIS 

Yes, my lord 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Shall we go into tea? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Do you like such simple pleasures? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I adore simple pleasures. They are the last 
refuge of the complex. But, if you wish, let us 
stay here. Yes, let us stay here. The Book of 
Life begins with a man and a woman in a garden. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

It ends with Revelations. 

38 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You fence divinely, but the button has come 
off your foil. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I have still the mask. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It makes your eyes lovelier. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Thank you. Come. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

[Sees Mrs. Arbuthnois letter on table y and takes 
it upy and looks at envelope^ What a curious hand- 
writing ! It reminds me of the handwriting of a 
woman I used to know years ago. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Who? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Oh ! no one. No one in particular. A woman 
of no importance. \Throws letter down and passes 
up the steps of the terrace with Mrs, Allonby. They 
smile at each other,] 

ACT-DROP.

SECOND ACT 



G 



Scene — Drawing-room at Hunstantouy after 
dinner^ lamps lit. Door L. C. Door R. C. 

[Ladies seated on sofas.'] 



MRS. ALLONBY 

What a comfort it is to have got rid of the 
men for a little! 



LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes, men persecute us dreadfully, don't they ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Persecute us? I wish they did. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear! 

MRS. ALLONBY 

The annoying thing is that the wretches can be 
perfectly happy without us. That is why I think 
it is every woman's duty never to leave them 

43 



alone for a single moment, except during this 
short breathing space after dinner ; without which 
I believe we poor women would be absolutely 
worn to shadows. 

[Enter servants with coffee,'] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Worn to shadows, dear? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Yes, Lady Hunstanton. It is such a strain 
keeping men up to the mark. They are always 
trying to escape from us. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

It seems to me that it is we who are always 
trying to escape from them. Men are so very, 
very heartless. They know their power, and use 
it 

LADY CAROLINE 

{Takes coffee from servant?] What stuff and 
nonsense all this about men is! The thing to 
do is to keep men in their proper place. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

But what is their proper place. Lady Caroline ? 

LADY CAROLINE 

Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby. 

44 



MRS. ALLONBY 



[Takes coffee from servant.] Really? And if 
they are not married? 

LADY CAROLINE 

If they are not married they should be looking 
after a wife. It's perfectly scandalous the amount 
of bachelors who are going about society. There 
should be a law passed to compel them all to 
marry within twelve months. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

[Re/uses coffee.] But if they're in love with 
some one who is, perhaps, tied to another ? 

LADY CAROLINE 

In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be 
married off in a week to some plain, respectable 
girl, in order to teach them not to meddle with 
other people's property. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I don't think we should ever be spoken of as 
other people's property. All men are married 
women's property. That is the only true definition 
of what married women's property really is. But 
we don't belong to any one. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so, 

45 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

But do you really think, dear Caroline, that 
legislation would improve matters in any way? 
I am told that, now-a-days, all the married men 
live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like 
married men. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I certainly never know one from the other. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Oh, I think one can always know at once 
whether a man has home claims upon his life or 
not. I have noticed a very, very sad expression 
in the eyes of so many married men. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are 
horribly tedious when they are good husbands, 
and abominably conceited when they are not. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Well, I suppose the type of husband has com- 
pletely changed since my young days, but I'm 
bound to state that poor dear Hunstanton was 
the most delightful of creatures, and as good as 
gold. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note ; 
I am tired of meeting him. 

46 



LADY CAROLINE 

But you renew him from time to time, don't 
you? 



MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh, no, Lady Caroline. I have only had one 
husband as yet. I suppose you look upon me as 
quite an amateur? 

LADY CAROLINE 

With your views of life, I wonder you married 
at all. 



MRS. ALLONBY 

So do I. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear child, I believe you are really very 
happy in your married life, but that you like to 
hide your happiness from others. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Oh, I hope not, dear. I knew his mother quite 
well. She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord 
Cowland's daughters. 

47 



LADY CAROLINE 

Victoria Stratton ? I remember her perfectly. 
A silly, fair-haired woman with no chin. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Ah, Ernest has a chin. He has a very strong 
chin, a square chin. Ernest's chin is far too 
square. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

But do you really think a man's chin can be too 
square? I think a man should look very, very 
strong, and that his chin should be quite, quite 
square. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady 
Stutfield. It is only fair to tell you beforehand 
he has got no conversation at all. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

I adore silent men. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh, Ernest isn't silent. He talks the whole 
time. But he has got no conversation. What he 
talks about I don't know. I haven't listened to 
him for years. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Have you never forgiven him, then ? How sad 

48 



that seems! But all life is very, very sad, is it 
not? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a tnauvais quart 
(theure made up of exquisite moments. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes, there are moments, certainly. But was it 
something very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did ? 
Did he become angry with you and say anything 
that was unkind or true? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh, dear no. Ernest is invariably calm. That 
is one of the reasons he always gets on my nerves. 
Nothing is so aggravating as calmness. There is 
something positively brutal about the good temper 
of most modern men, I wonder we women stand 
it as well as we do. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes, men's good temper shows they are not so 
sensitive as we are, not so finely strung. It makes 
a great barrier often between man and wife, does 
it not ? But I would so much like to know what 
was the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Well, I will tell you if you solemnly promise 
to tell everybody else. 

49 « 



LADY STUTFIELD 

Thank you, thank you. I will make a point of 
repeating it 

MRS. ALLONBY 

When Ernest and I were engaged he swore to 
me positively on his knees that he never had 
loved anyone before in the whole course of his 
life. I was very young at the time, so I didn't 
believe him, I needn't tell you. Unfortunately, 
however, I made no enquiries of any kind till after 
I had been actually married four or five months. 
I found out then that what he had told me was 
perfectly true. And that sort of thing makes a 
man so absolutely uninteresting. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear! 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Men always want to be a woman's first love. 
That is their clumsy vanity. We women have a 
more subtle instinct about things. What we like 
is to be a man's last romance. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

I see what you mean. It's very, very beautiful. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear child, you don't mean to tell me that 
you won't forgive your husband because he never 
loved anyone else? Did you ever hear such a 
thing, Caroline? I am quite surprised, 

5<^ 



LADY CAROLINE 

Oh, women have become so highly educated, 
Jane, that nothing should surprise us now-a-days, 
except happy marriages. They apparently are 
getting remarkably rare. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh, they're quite out of date. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Except among the middle classes, I have been 
told. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

How like the middle classes! 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes — is it not? — very, very like them 

LADY CAROLINE 

If what you tell us about the middle classes is 
true. Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their 
credit. It is much to be regretted that in our rank 
of life the wife should be so persistently frivolous, 
under the impression, apparently, that it is the 
proper thing to be. It is to that I attribute the 
unhappiness of so many marriages we all know 
of in society. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Do you know. Lady Caroline, I don't think the 

51 



frivolity of the wife has ever anything to do with 
it. More marriages are ruined now-a-days by the 
comnnon sense of the husband than by anything 
else. How can a woman be expected to be happy 
with a man who insists on treating her as if she 
were a perfectly rational being? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear ! 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man, 
belongs to a sex that has been rational for millions 
and millions of years. He can't help himself. It 
is in his race. The history of woman is very 
different. We have always been picturesque pro- 
tests against the mere existence of common sense. 
We saw its dangers from the first. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly 
most, most trying. Do tell me your conception of 
the Ideal Husband. I think it would be so very, 
very helpful. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

The Ideal Husband ? There couldn't be such 
a thing. The institution is wrong. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

The Ideal Man, then, in his relation to us. 

52 



LADY CAROLINE 

He would probably be extremely realistic. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

The Ideal Man ! Oh, the Ideal Man should 
talk to us as if we were goddesses, and treat us as 
if we were children. He should refuse all our 
serious requests, and gratify every one of our 
whims. He should encourage us to have caprices, 
and forbid us to have missions. He should always 
say much more than he means, and always mean 
much more than he says. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

But how could he do both, dear ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

He should never run down other pretty women. 
That would show he had no taste, or make one 
suspect that he had too much. No ; he should be 
nice about them all, but say that somehow they 
didn't attract him. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear 
about other women. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

If we ask him a question about anything, he 
should give us an answer all about ourselves. 

S3 



He should invariably praise us for whatever 
qualities he knows we haven't got. But he 
should be pitiless, quite pitiless, in reproaching 
us for the virtues that we have never dreamed of 
possessing. He should never believe that we 
know the use of useful things. That would be 
unforgiveable. But he should shower on us every- 
thing we don't want. 

LADY CAROLINE 

As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay 
bills and compliments. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

He should persistently compromise us in public, 
and treat us with absolute respect when we are 
alone. And yet he should always be ready to have 
a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, 
and to become miserable, absolutely miserable, at 
a moment's notice, and to overwhelm us with just 
reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be 
positively violent at the end of half an hour, and 
to leave us for ever at a quarter to eight, when we 
have to go and dress for dinner. And when, after 
that, one has seen him for really the last time, and 
he has refused to take back the little things he 
has given one, and promised never to communicate 
with one again, or to write one any foolish letters, 
he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and tele- 
graph to one all day long, and send one little 
notes every half hour by a private hansom, and 
dine quite alone at the club, so that every one 

54 



should know how unhappy he was. And after a 
whole dreadful week, during which one has gone 
about everywhere with one's husband, just to show 
how absolutely lonely one was, he may be given a 
third last parting in the evening, and then, if his 
conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one 
has behaved really badly to him, he should be 
allowed to admit that he has been entirely in the 
wrong, and, when he has admitted that, it becomes 
a woman's duty to forgive, and one can do it all 
over again from the beginning, with variations. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

How clever you are, my dear ! you never mean 
a single word you say. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Thank you, thank you. It has been quite, 
quite entrancing. I must try and remember it all. 
There are such a number of details that are so 
very, very important. 

LADY CAROLINE 

But you have not told us yet what the reward 
of the Ideal Man is to be. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

His reward ? Oh, infinite expectation. That is 
quite enough for him. 

55 



LADY STUTFIELD 

But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are 
they not ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

That makes no matter. One should never 
surrender. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Not even to the Ideal Man. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Certainly not to him. Unless, of course, one 
wants to grow tired of him. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Oh ! . . . yes. I see that. It is very, very 
helpful. Do you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall 
ever meet the Ideal Man? Or are there more 
than one? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Oh, my dear ! 

MRS. ALLONBY 

[Going over to Aer.] What has happened ? Do 
tell me. 

56 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

[In a low voice.] I had completely forgotten 
that the American young lady has been in the 
room all the time. I am afraid some of this 
clever talk may have shocked her a little. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Ah, that will do her so much good ! 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Let us hope she didn't understand much. I 
think I had better go over and talk to her. 
[Rises and goes across to Hester Worsiey.] Well, 
dear Miss Worsley. [Sitting down beside her,] 
How quiet you have been in your nice little 
corner all this timel I suppose you have been 
reading a book ? There are so many books here 
in the library. 

HESTER 

No, I have been listening to the conversation. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

You mustn't believe everything that was said, 
you know, dear. 

HESTER 

I didn't believe any of it 

57 I 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

That is quite right, dear. 

HESTER 

[Continuing,] I couldn't believe that any 
woman could really hold such views of life as 
I have heard to-night from some of your guests. 
[An awkward pause.] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

I hear you have such pleasant society in 
America. Quite like our own in places. My 
son wrote to me. 

HESTER 

There are cliques in America, as elsewhere, 
Lady Hunstanton, but true American society 
consists simply of all the good women and good 
men we have in the country. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

What a sensible system, and I dare say quite 
pleasant too. I am afraid in England we have 
too many artificial social barriers. We don't see 
as much as we should of the middle and lower 
classes. 

HESTER 

In America we have no lower classes. 

58 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

Really? What a very, very strange arrange- 
ment! 

MRS. ALLONBY 

What is that dreadful girl talking about ? 

LADY STUTFIELD 

She is painfully natural, is she not ? 

LADY CAROLINE 

There are a great many things you haven't got 
in America, I am told, Miss Worsley. They say 
you have no ruins, and no curiosities. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

[To Lady Stutfield^ What nonsense I They 
have their mothers and their manners. 

HESTER 

The English aristocracy supply us with our 
curiosities. Lady Caroline. They are sent over 
to us every summer regularly in the steamers, 
and propose to us the day after they land. As 
for ruins, we are trying to build up something that 
will last longer than brick or stone. \Gets up to 
take her fan from tadie,] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

What is that, dear ? Ah, yes, an iron Exhibi- 
tion, is it not, at that place that has the curious 
name? 

59 



HESTER 

[Standing at table,'] We are trying to build up 
life, Lady Hunstanton, on a better, truer, purer 
basis than life rests on here. This sounds strange 
to you all, no doubt How could it sound other 
than strange ? You rich people in England, you 
don't know how you are Jiving. How could you 
know? You shut out from your society the 
gentle and the good. You laugh at the simple 
and the pure. Living, as you all do, on others, 
and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if 
you throw bread to the poor it is merely to keep 
them quiet for a season. With all your pomp 
and wealth and art, you don't know how to live — 
you don't even know that. You love the beauty 
that you can see and touch and handle, the beauty 
that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the 
unseen beauty of life, of the unseen beauty of a 
higher life, you know nothing. You have lost 
life's secret Oh, your English society seems to 
me shallow, selfish, foolish. It has blinded its 
eyes and stopped its ears. It lies like a leper in 
purple. It sits like a dead thing smeared with 
gold. It is all wrong, all wrong. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

I dont think one should know of these things. 
It is not very, very nice, is it ? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked 
English society so much. You were such a 

60 



success in it. And you were so much admired 
by the best people. I quite forget what Lord 
Henry Weston said of you — but it was most 
complimentary, and you know what an authority 
he is on beauty. 

HESTER 

Lord Henry Weston! I remember him, Lady 
Hunstanton. A man with a hideous smile and a 
hideous past. He is asked everywhere. No 
dinner-party is complete without him. What of 
those whose ruin is due to him ? They are out- 
casts. They are nameless. If you met them in 
the street you would turn your head away. I 
don't complain of their punishment. Let all 
women who have sinned be punished. 

[Mrs. Arbuthnot enters from terrace behind in a 
cloak with a lace veil over her head. She hears the 
last words and starts.] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear young lady ! 

HESTER 

It is right that they should be punished, but 
don't let them be the only ones to suflFer. If 
a man and a woman have sinned, let them both 
go forth into the desert to love or loathe each 
other there. Let them both be branded. Set 
a mark on each if you wish, but don't punish 
the one and let the other go free. Don't have 
one law for men and another for women. You 

6i 



are unjust to women in England. And till you 
count what is a shame in a woman to be an 
infamy in a man, you will always be unjust, and 
Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of 
Cloud, will be made dim to your eyes, or be not 
seen at all, or, if seen, not regarded. 

LADY CAROLINE 

Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are stand- 
ing up, ask you for my cotton that is just behind 
you ? Thank you. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot! I am so pleased 
you have come up. But I didn't hear you 
announced. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Oh, I came straight in from the terrace. Lady 
Hunstanton, just as I was. You didn't tell me 
you had a party. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Not a party. Only a few guests who are stay- 
ing in the house, and whom you must know. 
Allow me [Tries to help her. Rings beU\ Caro- 
line, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest 
friends. Lady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stut- 
field, Mrs. Allonby, and my young American 
friend. Miss Worsley, who has just been telling 
us all how wicked we are. 

HESTER 

I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, 

62 



Lady Hunstanton, but there are some things in 
Enlgand 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear young lady, there was a great deal 
of truth, I dare say, in what you said, and you 
looked very pretty while you said it, which is 
much more important, Lord Illingworth would 
tell us. The only point where I thought you 
were a little hard was about Lady Caroline's 
brother, about poor Lord Henry. He is really 
such good company. 

[Enter Footman.'] 

Take Mrs. Arbuthnot's things. 

[Exit Footman with wraps.] 

HESTER 

Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your 
brother. I am sorry for the pain I must have 
caused you — I 

LADY CAROLINE 

My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your 
little speech, if I may so term it, with which I 
thoroughly agreed, was the part about my brother. 
Nothing that you could possibly say could be too 
bad for him. I regard Henry as infamous, abso- 
lutely infamous. But I am bound to state, as 
you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent 
company, and he has one of the best cooks in 
London, and after a good dinner one can forgive 
anybody, even one's own relations. 

63 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

[To Miss Worsley^ Now, do come, dear, and 
make friends with Mrs. Arbuthnot She is one 
of the good, sweet, simple people you told us 
we never admitted into society. I am sorry to 
say Mrs. Arbuthnot comes very rarely to me. 
But that is not my fault. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

What a bore it is the men staying so long 
after dinner ! I expect they are saying the most 
dreadful things about us. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

Do you really think so ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I am sure of it 

LADY STUTFIELD 

How very, very horrid of them ! Shall we go 
on to the terrace ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers 
and the dowdies. \Rises and goes with Lady 
Stutfield to door L. C] We are only going to 
look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

You will find a great many, dear, a great many. 
But don't catch cold. \To Mrs, Arbuthnot^ We 
shall all miss Gerald so much, dear Mrs. Arbuth- 
not. 

64 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 



But has Lord Illing^orth really offered to make 
Gerald his secretary? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Oh, yes ! He has been most charming about it. 
He has the highest possible opinion of your boy. 
You don't know Lord Illingworth, I believe, dear. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I have never met him. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

You know him by name, no doubt ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I am afraid I don't. I live so much out of the 
world, and see so few people. I remember hearing 
years ago of an old Lord Illingworth who lived 
in Yorkshire, I think. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, yes, that would be the last Earl but one. 
He was a very curious man. He wanted to 
marry beneath him. Or wouldn't, I believe. 
There was some scandal about it. The present 
Lord Illingworth is quite different. He is very 
distinguished. He does — well, he does nothing, 
which I am afraid our pretty American visitor 
here thinks very wrong of anybody, and I don't 

65 K 



know that he cares much for the subjects in 
which you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot 
Do you think, Caroline, that Lord Illingrworth is 
interested in the Housing of the Poor ? 

LADY CAROLINE 

I should fancy not at all, Jane. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

We all have our different tastes, have we not? 
But Lord Illingworth has a very high position, 
and there is nothing he couldn't get if he chose 
to ask for it Of course he is comparatively a 
young man still, and he has only come to his 
title within — how long exactly is it, Caroline, 
since Lord Illingworth succeeded? 

LADY CAROLINE 

About four years, I think, Jane. I know it was 
the same year in which my brother had his last 
exposure in the evening newspapers. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, I remember. That would be about four 
years ago. Of course there were a great many 
people between the present Lord Illingrworth and 
the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot There was — who was 
there, Caroline? 

LADY CAROLINE 

There was poor Margaret's baby. You re- 

66 



member how anxious she was to have a boy, and 
it was a boy, but it died, and her husband died 
shortly afterwards, but she married almost im- 
mediately one of Lord Ascot's sons, who I am 
told beats her. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the 
family. And there was also, I remember, a 
clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic, or a 
lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget 
which, but I know the Court of Chancery in- 
vestigated the matter, and decided that he was 
quite sane. And I saw him afterwards at poor 
Lord Plumstead's with straws in his hair, or 
something very odd about him. I can't recall 
what. I often regret. Lady Caroline, that dear 
Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son get the 
title. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Lady Cecilia ? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Lord lUingworth's mother, dear Mrs. Arbuth- 
not, was one of the Duchess of Jemingham's 
pretty daughters, and she married Sir Thomas 
Harford, who wasn't considered a very good 
match for her at the time, though he was said 
to be the handsomest man in London. I knew 
them all quite intimately, and both the sons, 
Arthur and Geoi^e. 

67 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, 
Lady Hunstanton? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field. 
Or was it fishing, Caroline ? I forget, but George 
came in for everything. I always tell him that 
no younger son has ever had such good luck as 
he has had. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald 
at once. Might I see him ? Can he be sent for ? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Certainly, dear. I will send one of the servants 
into the dining-room to fetch him. I don't know 
what keeps the gentlemen so long.' [Ring's de/l.] 
When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain 
George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant 
young man about town, with not a penny of 
money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave 
him. She was quite devoted to him. Chiefly, I 
fancy, because he was on bad terms with his 
father. Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon. [To 
servant.] It doesn't matter. 

[Enter Sir John and Doctor Daubeny. Sir 
John goes over to Lady Stutjield^ Doctor Daubeny 
to Lady Hunstanton,] 

68 



THE ARCHDEACON 

Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining. 
I have never enjoyed myself more. [Sees Mrs, 
Arbuthnot.'\ Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

[To Doctor Daubeny,'] You see I have got 
Mrs. Arbuthnot to come to me at last. 

THE ARCHDEACON 

That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton. 
Mrs. Daubeny will be quite jealous of you. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not 
come with you to-night. Headache as usual, I 
suppose ? 

THE ARCHDEACON 

Yes, Lady Hunstanton, a perfect martyr. But 
she is happiest alone. She is happiest alone. 

LADY CAROLINE 

[ To her husband^ John ! [Sir John goes over 
to his wife. Doctor Daubeny talks to Lady Hun- 
stanton and Mrs, Arbuthnot^ 

[Mrs, Arbuthnot watches Lord Illingworth the 
whole time. He has passed across the room with- 
out noticing her, and approaches Mrs, Allonby, who 
with Lady Stutfield is standing by the door look- 
ing on the terrace,"] 

69 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

How is the most charming woman in the 
world ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

[Ta^ng Lady Stutfield by the Aand,] We are 
both quite well, thank you, Lord Illingworth. 
But what a short time you have been in the 
dining-room I It seems as if we had only just 
left. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I was bored to death. Never opened my lips 
the whole time. Absolutely longing to come in 
to you. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

You should have. The American girl has been 
giving us a lecture. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Really? All Americans lecture, I believe. I 
suppose it is something in their climate. What 
did she lecture about? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Oh, Puritanism, of course. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I am going to convert her, am I not? How 
long do you give me? 

70 



MRS. ALLONBY 

A week. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

A week is more than enough. 
[EnUr Gerald and Lord Alfred^ 

GERALD 

\Going to Mrs. Arbuthnot^ Dear mother ! 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Gerald, I don't feel at all well. See me home, 
Gerald. I shouldn't have come. 

GERALD 

I am so sorry, mother. Certainly. But you 
must know Lord Illingworth first {Goes across 
room,] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Not to-night, Gerald. 

GERALD 

Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know 
my mother. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

With the greatest pleasure. [To Mrs. Aliondy.] 
rU be back in a moment. People's mothers 
always bore me to death. AH women become 
like their mothers. That is their tragedy. 

71 



MRS. ALLONBY 

No man does. That is his. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What a delightful mood you are in to-night ! 

[Turns round and goes across with Gerald to 
Mrs. Arbuthnot, When he sees her^ he starts back 
in wonder. Then slowly his eyes turn towards 
Gerald^ 

GERALD 

Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has 
offered to take me as his private secretary. \Mrs. 
Arbuthnot bows coldly^ It is a wonderful opening 
for me, isn't it ? I hope he won't be disappointed 
in me, that is all. You'll thank Lord lUingfworth, 
mother, won't you ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Lord Illingworth is very good, I am sure, to 
interest himself in you for the moment. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

{Putting his hand on Gerald's shoulder^ Oh, 
Gerald and I are great friends already, Mrs. . . . 
Arbuthnot. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

There can be nothing in common between you 
and my son, Lord Illingworth. 

GERALD 

Dear mother, how can you say so? Of course 

72 



Lord Illingworth is awfully clever and that sort of 
thing. There is nothing Lord Illingworth doesn't 
know. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH' 

My dear boy ! 

GERALD 

He knows more about life than anyone I have 
ever met. I feel an awful duffer when I am 
with you, Lord Illingworth. Of course I have 
had so few advantages. I have not * been to 
Eton or Oxford like other chaps, but Lord 
Illingworth doesn't seem to mind that. He has 
been awfully good to me, mother. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Lord Illingworth may change his mind. He 
may not really want you as his secretary. 

GERALD 

Mother ! 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

You must remember, as you said yourself, you 
have had so few advantages. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for 
a moment Do come over. 

73 ^ 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot? Now 
don't let your charming mother make any more 
difficulties, Gerald. The thing is quite settled, 
isn't it? 

GERALD 

I hope so. 

[Lord Illtngworth goes across to Mrs, Allonby,'] 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I thought you were never going to leave the 
lady in black velvet. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

She is excessively handsome. [Looks at Mrs. 
Ariutknot.] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Caroline, shall we all make a move to the 
music-room? Miss Worsley is going to play. 
You'll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, won't you ? 
You don't know what a treat is in store for you. 
[To Doctor Daubeny^ I must really take Miss 
Worsley down some afternoon to the rectory. I 
should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear 
her on the violin. Ah, I forgot. Dear Mrs. 
Daubeny's hearing is a little defective, is it not ? 

THE ARCHDEACON 

Her deafness is a great privation to her. She 

74 



can't even hear my sermons now. She reads 
them at home. But she has many resources in 
herself — many resources. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

She reads a good deal, I suppose ? 

THE ARCHDEACON 

Just the very largest print. The eyesight is 
rapidly going. But she is never morbid, never 
morbid. 

GERALD 

[To Lord Illingworth^ Do speak to my 
mother, Lord lUingworth, before you go into 
the music-room. She seems to think, somehow, 
you don't mean what you said to me. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Aren't you coming ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

In a few moments. Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. 
Arbuthnot would allow me, I would like to say 
a few words to her, and we will join you later on. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, of course. You will have a great deal to 
say to her, and she will have a great deal to 
thank you for. It is not every son who gets such 

75 



an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot. But I know you 
appreciate that, dear. 

LADY CAROLINE 

John! 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Now don't keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord 
IlHngworth. We can't spare her. 

[Exit following the other guests, Sound of 
violin heard from music-room^ 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

So that is our son, Rachel ! Well, I am very 
proud of him. He is a Harford every inch of 
him. By the way, why Arbuthnot, Rachel? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

One name is as good as another, when one 
has no right to any name. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I suppose so — But why Gerald ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

After a man whose heart I broke — after my 
father. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Well, Rachel, what is over is over. All I have 

76 



got to say now is that I am very, very much 
pleased with our boy. The world will know 
him merely as my private secretary, but to 
me he will be something very near and very 
dear. It is a curious thing, Rachel ; my life 
seemed to be quite complete. It was not so. 
It lacked something, it lacked a son. I have 
found my son now. I am glad I have found him. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

You have no right to claim him, or the smallest 
part of him. The boy is entirely mine, and shall 
remain mine. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself 
for over twenty years. Why not let me have him 
for a little now? He is quite as much mine as 
yours. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Are you talking of the child who you aban- 
doned ? Of the child who, as far as you are 
concerned, might have died of hunger and of 
want? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me. 
It was not I who left you. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I left you because you refused to give the 

77 



child a name. Before my son was born, t 
implored you to marry me. 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 



I had no expectations then. And besides, 
Rachel, I wasn't much older than you were. I 
was only twenty-two. I was twenty-one, I believe, 
when the whole thing began in your father's 
garden. 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

When a man is old enough to do wrong, he 
should be old enough to do right also. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are 
always interesting, but generalities in morals mean 
absolutely nothing. As for saying I left our child 
to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly. My 
mother offered you six hundred a year. But 
you wouldn't take anything. You simply dis- 
appeared, and carried the child away with you. 

MRS ARBUTHNOT 

I wouldn't have accepted a penny from her. 
Your father was different. He told you in my 
presence, when we were [in Paris, that it was your 
duty to marry me. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is 

78 



not what one does one's-self. Of course I was 
influenced by my mother. Every man is when 
he is young. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I am glad to hear you say so. Gerald shall 
certainly not go away with you. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What nonsense, Rachel ! 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Do you think I will allow my son 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Our son. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

My son [Lord Illingworth shrugs his shoulders^ 

to go away with the man who spoiled my 

youth, who ruined my life, who has tainted 
every moment of my days? You don't realise 
what my past has been in suffering and shame. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I 
think Gerald's future considerably more important 
than your past 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Gerald cannot separate his future from my 
past. 

79 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

That is exactly what he should do. That is 
exactly what you should help him to do. What 
a typical woman you are! You talk sentimen- 
tally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole 
time. But don't let us have a scene. Rachel, I 
want you to look at this matter from the common 
sense point of view, from the point of view of 
what is best for our son, leaving you and me out 
of the question. What is our son at present? 
An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank 
in a third-rate English town. If you imagine he 
is quite happy in such a position, you are mis- 
taken. He is thoroughly discontented. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He was not discontented till he met you. You 
have made him so. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Of course I made him so. Discontent is the 
first step in the progress of a man or a nation. 
But I did not leave him with a mere longing for 
things he could not get. No, I made him a 
charming offer. He jumped at it, I need hardly 
say. Any young man would. And now, simply 
because it turns out that I am the boy's own 
father and he my own son, you propose practically 
to ruin his career. That is to say, if I were a 
perfect stranger you would allow Gerald to go 
away with me, but as he is my own flesh and 
blood, you won't. How utterly illogical you are ! 

80 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I will not allow him to go. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

How can you prevent it? What excuse can 
you give to him for making him decline such an 
offer as mine ? I won't tell him in what relations 
I stand to him, I need hardly say. But you 
daren't tell him. You know that Look how you 
have brought him up. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I have brought him up to be a good man. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Quite so. And what is the result ? You have 
educated him to be your judge, if he ever finds 
you out. And a bitter, an unjust judge he will 
be to you. Don't be deceived, Rachel. Children 
begin by loving their parents. After a time, they 
judge them. Rarely, if ever, do they forgive 
them. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

George, don't take my son away from me. I 
have had twenty years of sorrow, and I have only 
had one thing to love me, only one thing to love. 
You have had a life of joy and pleasure, and 
success. You have been qu;te happy. You have 
never thought of us. There was no reason, 
according to your views of life, why you should 
have remembered us at all. Your meeting us 

8i M 



was a mere accident, a horrible accident. Forget 
it Don't come now and rob me of ... of all I 
have, of all I have in the whole world. You are 
so rich in other things. Leave me the little vine- 
yard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden 
and the well of water ; the ewe-lamb God sent 
me, in pity or in wrath, oh ! leave me that 
George, don't take Gerald from me. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Rachel, at the present moment you are not 
necessary to Gerald's career; I am. There is 
nothing more to be said on the subject 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I will not let him go. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Here is Gerald. He has a right to decide for 
himself. 

[Enfer Gerald,'] 

GERALD 

Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it 
all with Lord lUingworth ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I have not, Grerald. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Your mother seems not to like your coming 
with me, for some reason. 

82 



GERALD 

Why, mother ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I thought you were quite happy here with me, 
Gerald. I didn't know you were so anxious to 
leave me. 

GERALD 

Mother, how can you talk like that! Of 
course I have been quite happy with you. But 
a man can't stay always with his mother. No 
chap does. I want to make myself a position, to 
do something. I thought you would have been 
proud to see me Lord Illingworth's secretary. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I do not think you would be suitable as a 
private secretary to Lord Illingworth. You have 
no qualifications. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I don't wish to seem to interfere for a moment, 
Mrs. Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection 
is concerned, I surely am the best judge. And I 
can only tell you that your son has all the 
qualifications I had hoped for. He has more, in 
fact, than I had even thought of. Far more. 
[Mrs. Arbuthnot remains silent^ Have you any 
other reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don't wish 
your son to accept this post? 

83 



GERALD 

Have you, mother ? Do answer. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray, say 
it. We are quite by ourselves here. Whatever 
it is, I need not say I will not repeat it. 

GERALD 

Mother ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

If you would like to be alone with your son, 
I will leave you. You have some other reason 
you don't wish me to hear. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I have no other reason. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing 
as settled. Come, you and I will smoke a 
cigarette on the terrace together. And Mrs. 
Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you that I think you 
have acted very, very wisely. 

[Exit with Gerald. Mrs. Arbuthnot is left alone. 
She stands immobile with a look of unutterable 
sorrow on her face.'\ 

Act-drop.

THIRD ACT 



Scene — The Picture Gallery at Hunstanton, 
Door at back leading on to terrcu:e. 

[Lord Illingworth and Gerald R. C. Lord 
Illingworth lolling on a sofa. Gerald in a ckair,] 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Thoroughly sensible woman, your mother, 
Gerald. I knew she would come round in the 
end. 

GERALD 

My mother is awfully conscientious. Lord 
Illingworth, and I know she doesn't think I am 
educated enough to be your secretary. She is 
perfectly right, too. I was fearfully idle when I 
was at school, and I couldn't pass an examination 
now to save my life. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

My dear Gerald, examinations are of no value 
whatsoever. If a man is a gentleman, he knows 
quite enough, and if he is not a gentleman, what- 
ever he knows is bad for him. 

87 



GERALD 

But I am so ignorant of the world, Lord 
lUingworth. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Don't be afraid, Gerald, Remember that you've 
got on your side the most wonderful thing in the 
world — ^youth ! There is nothing like youth. 
The middle-aged are mortgaged to Life. The old 
are in Life's lumber-room. But youth is the Lord 
of Life. Youth has a kingdom waiting for it. 
Every one is born a king, and most people die in 
exile like most kings. To win back my youth, 
Gerald, there is nothing I wouldn't do— except 
take exercise, get up early, or be a useful member 
of the community. 

GERALD 

But you don't call yourself old. Lord Illingworth? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I am old enough to be your father, Gerald. 

GERALD 

I don't remember my father ; he died years ago. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

So Lady Hunstanton told me 

GERALD 

It is very curious my mother never talks to me 

88 



about my father. I sometimes think she must 
have married beneath her. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

[Winces sligktfy.l Really? [Goes over and 
puts his hand on Gerald^ s shoulder^ You have 
missed not having a father, I suppose, Gerald ? 

GERALD 

Oh, no, my mother has been so good to me. 
No one ever had such a mother as I have had. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I am quite sure of that. Still I should imagine 
that most mothers don't quite understand their 
sons. Don't realise, I mean, that a son has 
ambitions, a desire to see life, to make himself a 
name. After all, Gerald, you couldn't be expected 
to pass your life in such a hole as Wrockley, 
could you? 

GERALD 

Oh, no ! It would be dreadful ! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

A mother's love is very touching, of course, but 
it is often curiously selfish. I mean, there is a 
good deal of selfishness in it 

GERALD 

[Slowly.] I suppose there is. 

89 N 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Your mother is a thoroughly good woman. 
But good women have such a limited view of life, 
their horizon is so small, their interests are so 
petty, aren't they? 

GERALD 

They are awfully interested, certainly in things 
we don't care much about. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I suppose your mother is very religious and 
that sort of thing? 

GERALD 

Oh, yes, she is always going to church. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Ah ! she is not modem, and to be modern is 
the only thing worth being now-a-days. You 
want to be modern, don't you, Gerald ? You want 
to know life as it really is. Not to be put off 
with any old-fashioned tiieories about life. Well, 
what you'll have to do at present is simply to fit 
yourself for the best society. A man who can 
dominate a London dinner-table can dominate the 
world. The future belongs to the dandy. It is 
the exquisites who are going to rule. 

GERALD 

I should like to wear nice things awfully, but 

90 



I have always been told that a man should not 
think too much about his clothes. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

People, now-a-days, are so absolutely superficial 
that they don't understand the philosophy of the 
superficial. By the way, Gerald, you should learn 
how to tie your tie better. Sentiment is all very 
well for the button-hol6. But the essential thing 
for the necktie is style. A well-tied tie is the first 
serious step in life. 

GERALD 

[LaugAing.] I might be able to learn how to 
tie a tie. Lord Illingworth, but I should never be 
able to talk as you do. I don't know how to 
talk. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Oh ! talk to every woman as if you loved her, 
and to every man as if he bored you, and at the 
end of your first season you will have the repu- 
tation of possessing the most perfect social tact. 

GERALD 

But it is very difficult to get into society, 
isn't it? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

To get into the best society, now-a-days, one 
has either to feed people, amuse people, or shock , 
people — that is all! 

91 



GERALD 

I suppose society is wonderfully delightful! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

To be in it is merely a bore. But to be out of 
it, simply a tragedy. Society is a necessary thing. 
No man has any real success in this world unless 
he has got women to back him, and women rule 
society. If you have not got women on your side 
you are quite over. You might just as well be a 
barrister, or a stockbroker, or a journalist at once. 

GERALD 

It is very difficult to understand women, is it 
not? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You should never try to understand them. 
Women are pictures. Men are problems. If you 
want to know what a woman really means — which, 
by the way, is always a dangerous thing to do — 
look at her, don't listen to her. 

GERALD 

But women are awfully clever, aren't they ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

One should always tell them so. But to the 
philosopher, my dear Gerald, women represent the 
triumph of matter over mind — ^just as men repre- 
sent the triumph of mind over morals. 

92 



GERALD 

How then can women have so much power as 
you say they have ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

The history of women is the history of the worst 
form of tyranny the world has ever known. The 
tyranny of the weak over the strong. It is the 
only tyranny that lasts. 

GERALD 

But haven't women got a refining influence ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Nothing refines but the intellect. 

GERALD 

Still there are many different kinds of women, 
aren't there ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Only two kinds in society : the plain and the 
coloured. 

GERALD 

But there are good women in society, aren't 
there ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Far too many. 

GERALD 

But do you think women shouldn't be good ? 

93 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

One should never tell them so. They'd all 
become good at once. Women are a fascinatingly 
wilful sex. Every woman is a rebel, and usually 
in wild revolt against herself. 

GERALD 

You have never been married, Lord lUingworth, 
have you ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Men marry because they are tired ; women 
because they are curious. Both are disappointed. 

GERALD 

But don't you think one can be happy when one 
is married. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Perfectly happy, but the happiness of a married 
man, my dear Gerald, depends on the people he 
has not married. 

GERALD 

But if one is in love ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

One should always be in love. That is the 
reason one should never marry. 

GERALD 

Love is a very wonderful thing, isn't it ? 

94 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

When one is in love one begins by deceiving 
one's-self. And one ends by deceiving others. 
That is what the world calls a romance. But a 
really grande passion is comparatively rare now-a- 
days. It is the privilege of people who have 
nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle 
classes in a country, and the only possible expla- 
nation of us Harfords. 

GERALD 

Harfords, Lord Illingworth ? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

That is my family name. You should study 
the Peerage, Gerald. It is the one book a young 
man about town should know thoroughly, and 
it is the best thing in fiction the English have ever 
done. And now, Gerald, you are going into a 
perfectly new life with me, and I want you to 
know how to live. \Mrs, Arbuthnot appears on 
terrace behind^ For the world has been made by 
fools that wise men should live in it! 

[Enter L. C, Lady Hunstanton and Dr, Daubeny^ 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, here you are, dear Lord Illingworth. Well, 
I suppose you have been telling our young friend, 
Gerald, what his new duties are to be, and giving 
him a great deal of good advice over a pleasant 
cigarette. 

95 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I have been giving him the best of advice, Lady 
Hunstanton, and the best of cigarettes. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

I am so sorry I was not here to listen to you, 
but I suppose I am too old now to learn. Except 
from you, dear Archdeacon, when you are in your 
nice pulpit But then I always know what you are 
going to say, so I don't feel alarmed. [Sees Mrs. 
Arbutknoti Ah ! dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, do come 
and join us. Come, dear. [Enter Mrs, Arbuthnotl 
Gerald has been having such a long talk with 
Lord Illingworth ; I am sure you must feel very 
much flattered at the pleasant way in which every- 
thing has turned out for him. Let us sit down. 
[They sit dawn.'] And how is your beautiful em- 
broidery going on ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I am always at work. Lady Hunstanton. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Mrs. Daubeny embroiders a little, too, doesn't 
she? 

THE ARCHDEACON 

She was very deft with her needle once, quite 
a Dorcas. But the gout has crippled her fingers 
a good deal. She has not touched the tambour 
frame for nine or ten years. But she has many 
other amusements. She is very much interested 
in her own health. 

96 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah ! that is always a nice distraction, is it not ? 
Now what are you talking about, Lord Illing- 
worth? Do tell us. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I was on the point of explaining to Gerald that 
the world has always laughed at its own tragedies, 
that being the only way in which it has been able 
to bear them. And that, consequently, whatever 
the world has treated seriously belongs to the 
comedy side of things. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Now I am quite out of my depth. I usually 
am when Lord Illingworth says anything. And 
the Humane Society is most careless. They 
never rescue me. I am left to sink. I have a 
dim idea, dear Lord Illingworth, that you are 
always on the side of the sinners, and I know 
I always try to be on the side of the saints, but 
that is as far as I get And, after all, it may be 
merely the fancy of a drowning person. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

The only difference between the saint and the 
sinner is that every saint has a past, and every 
sinner has a future. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah ! that quite does for me. I haven't a word 
to say. You and I, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, are 

97 o 



behind the age. We can't follow Lord Illing- 
worth. Too much care was taken with our 
education, I am afraid. To have been well 
brought up is a great drawback now-a-days. It 
shuts one out from so much. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I should be sorry to follow Lord Illingworth in 
any of his opinions. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

You are quite right, dear. 

[Gerald shrugs his shoulders and looks irritably 
over at his mother. Enter Lady Caroline^ 

LADY CAROLINE 

Jane, have you seen John anywhere ? 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

You needn't be anxious about him, dear. He 
is with Lady Stutfield ; I saw them sometime ago 
in the Yellow Drawing-room. They seem quite 
happy together. You are not going, Caroline? 
Pray sit down. 

LADY CAROLINE 

I think I had better look after John. 

\Exit Lady Caroline^ 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

It doesn't do to pay men so much attention. 
And Caroline has really nothing to be anxious 

98 



about. Lady Stutfield is quite sympathetic. She 
is just as sympathetic about one thing as she is 
about another. A beautiful nature. 

[Enter Sir John and Mrs. Aiioniy,] 

Ah ! here is Sir John ! And with Mrs. Allonby, 
too. I suppose it was Mrs. Allonby I saw him 
with. Sir John, Caroline has been looking every- 
where for you. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

We have been waiting for her in the Music- 
room, dear Lady Hunstanton. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah ! the Music-room of course. I thought it 
was the Yellow Drawing-room, my memory is 
getting so defective. [To the Archdeacon^ Mrs. 
Daubeny has a wonderful memory, hasn't she? 

THE ARCHDEACON 

She used to be quite remarkable for her 
memory, but since her last attack, she recalls 
chiefly the events of her early childhood. But she 
finds great pleasure in such restrospections, great 
pleasure. 

[Enter Lady Stutfield and Mr. KelviL'] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah ! dear Lady Stutfield ! And what has Mr. 
Kelvil been talking to you about? 

LADY STUTFIELD 

About Bimetallism, as well as I remember, 

99 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

Bimetallism I Is that quite a nice subject? 
However, I know people discuss everything very 
freely now-a-days. What did Sir John talk to 
you about, dear Mrs. AUonby? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

About Patagonia. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Really ? What a remote topic ! But very im- 
proving, I have no doubt. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

He has been most interesting on the subject 
of Patagonia. Savages seem to have quite the 
same views as cultured people on almost all 
subjects. They are excessively advanced. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

What do they do ? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Apparently everything. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Well, it is very gratifying, dear Archdeacon, is 
it not, to find that Human Nature is permanently 
one. — On the whole, the world is the same world, 
is it not? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

The world is simply divided into two classes — 

IQQ 



those who believe the incredible, like the public — 
and those who do the improbable — 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Like yourself? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Yes ; I am always astonishing myself. It is the 
only thing that makes life worth living. 

LADY STUTFIELD 

And what have you been doing lately that 
astonishes you? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I have been discovering all kinds of beautiful 
qualities in my own nature. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Ah I don't become quite perfect all at once. 
Do it gradually. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I don't intend to grow perfect at all. At least, 
I hope I shan't. It would be most inconvenient. 
Women love us for our defects. If we have 
enough of them, they will forgive us everything, 
even our gigantic intellects. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

It is premature to ask us to forgive analysis. 

XQX 



We forgive adoration; that is quite as much as 
should be expected from us. 

[Enter Lord Alfred, He joins Lady S tut field!] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah ! we women should forgfive everything, 
shouldn't we, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot? I am sure 
you agree with me in that. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I do not, Lady Hunstanton. I think there are 
many things women should never forgive. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

What sort of things ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

The ruin of another woman's life. 

[Moves slowly away to back of stage,] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah ! those things are very sad, no doubt, but I 
believe there are admirable homes where people 
of that kind are looked after and reformed, and I 
think, on the whole, that the secret of life is to 
take things very, very easily. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

The secret of life is never to have an emotion 
that is unbecoming. 

IQ9 



LADY STUTFIELD 

The secret of life is to appreciate the pleasure 
of being terribly, terribly deceived. 

KELVIL 

The secret of life is to resist temptation, Lady 
Stutfield. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

There is no secret of life. Life's aim, if it has 
one, is simply to be always looking for tempta- 
tions. There are not nearly enough. I sometimes 
pass a whole day without coming across a single 
one. It is quite dreadful. It makes one so 
nervous about the future. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

[SAakes her fan at Aim.] 1 don't know how it 
is, dear Lord lUingworth, but everything you have 
said to-day seems to me excessively immoral. It 
has been most interesting listening to you. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

All thought is immoral. Its very essence is 
destruction. If you think of anything you kill it. 
Nothing survives being thought of. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

I don't understand a word. Lord lUingworth. 
But I have no doubt it is all quite true. Person- 
ally, I have very little to reproach myself with on 
the score of thinking. I don't believe in women 

103 



thinking too much. Women should think in 
moderation, as they should do all things in 
moderation. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Moderation is a fatal thing. Lady Hunstanton. 
Nothing succeeds like excess. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

I hope I shall remember that It sounds an 
admirable maxim. But I am banning to forget 
everything. It's a g^eat misfortune. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is one of your most facsinating qualities. 
Lady Hunstanton. No woman should have a 
memory. Memory in a woman is the beginning 
of dowdiness. One can always tell from a woman's 
bonnet whether she has got a memory or not 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

How charming you are, dear Lord Illingworth. 
You always find out that one's most glaring fault 
is one's most important virtue. You have the 
most comforting views of life. 

[En^er FarguAar.] 

FARQUHAR 

Doctor Daubeny's carriage. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear Archdeacon ! It is only half past ten. 

104 



THE ARCHDEACON 

[Rising:] I am afraid I must go, Lady Hun- 
stanton. Tuesday is always one of Mrs. Daubeny's 
bad nights. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

[Rising.] Well, I won't keep you from her. 
[Goes with him towards door.] I have told Far- 
quhar to put a brace of partridge into the 
carriage. Mrs. Daubeny may fancy them. 

THE ARCHDEACON 

It is very kind of you, but Mrs. Daubeny never 
touches solids now. Lives entirely on jellies. 
But she is wonderfully cheerful, wonderfully cheer- 
ful. She has nothing to complain of. 

[Exit with Lady Hunstanton^ 

MRS. ALLONBY 

[Goes over to Lord Illingworth.] There is a 
beautiful moon to-night 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Let us go and look at it. To look at anything 
that is inconsistent is charming now-a-days. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

You have your looking-glass. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is unkind. It merely shows me my wrinkles. 

105 p 



MRS. ALLONBY 

Mine is better behaved. It never tells me the 
truth. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Then it is in love with you. 

[Exeunt Sir Jokn^ Lady Stutfield^ Mr. Kelvil^ 
and Lord Alfred^ 

GERALD 

\To Lord lUingworth.l May I come too? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Do, my dear boy. [Moves towards door with 
Mrs. AUonby and Gerald^ 

[Lady Caroline enters^ looks rapidly rounds and 
goes out in opposite direction to that taken by Sir 
John and Lady Stutfield,"] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Gerald ! 

GERALD 

What, mother ? 

[Exit Lord Illingworth with Mrs. Allonly.] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It's getting late. Let us go home. 

GERALD 

, My dear mother, do let us wait a little longer. 

196 



Lord IlUngworth is so delightful, and, by the way, 
mother, I have a great surprise for you. We are 
starting for India at the end of this month. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Let us go home. 

GERALD 

If you really want to, of course, mother, but I 
must bid good-bye to Lord Illingworth first. I'll 
be back in five minutes. [Exit.] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Let him leave me if he chooses, but not with 
him — not with him ! I couldn't bear it. [ Walks 
up and dawn.] 

[Enter Hester.] 

HESTER 

What a lovely night it is, Mrs. Arbuthnot. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Is it? 

HESTER 

Mrs. Arbuthnot, I wish you would let us be 
friends. You are so different from the other women 
here. When you came into the Drawing-room 
this evening, somehow you brought with you a 
sense of what is good and pure in life. I had 

107 



been foolish. There are things that are right to 
say, but that may be said at tiie wrong time and 
to the wrong people. 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 



I heard what you said. I agree with it, Miss 
Worsley. 

HESTER 

I didn't know you had heard it But I knew 
you would agree with me. A woman who has 
sinned should be punished, shouldn't she? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Yes. 

HESTER 

She shouldn't be allowed to come into the 
society of good men and women? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

She should not. 

HESTER 

And the man should be punished in the same 
way? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

In the same way. And the children, if there 
are children, in the same way also. 

1 08 



HESTER 

Yes, it is right that the sins of the parents should 
be visited on the children. It is a just law. It 
is God's law. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It is one of God's terrible laws. 

[Moves away to fireplace^ 

HESTER 

You are distressed about your son leaving you, 
Mrs. Arbuthnot? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Yes. 

HESTER 

Do you like him going away with Lord Illing- 
worth ? Of course there is position, no doubt, and 
money, but position and money are not everything, 
are they ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

They are nothing ; they bring misery. 

HESTER 

Then why do you let your son go with him ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He wishes it himself. 

109 



HESTER 

But if you asked him he would stay, would he 
not? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He has set his heart on going. 

HESTER 

He couldn't refuse you anything. He loves you 
too much. Ask him to stay. Let me send him 
in to you. He is on the terrace at this moment 
with Lord Illingworth. I heard them laughing 
together as I passed through the Music-room. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Don't trouble, Miss Worsley, I can wait. It is 
of no consequence. 

HESTER 

No, rU tell him you want him. Do— do ask 
him to stay. 

[Exit Hester.] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He won't come — I know he won't come. 

[Enter Lady Caroline. She looks round 
anxiously. Enter Gerald^ 

LADY CAROLINE 

Mr. Arbuthnot, may I ask you is Sir John any- 
where on the terrace ? 

no 



GERALD 

No, Lady Caroline, he is not on the terrace. 

LADY CAROLINE 

It is very curious. It is time for him to retire. 

[Exii Lady Caroline^ 

GERALD 

Dear mother, I am afraid I kept you waiting. 
I forgot all about it I am so happy to-night, 
mother ; I have never been so happy. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

At the prospect of going away ? 

GERALD 

Don't put it like that, mother. Of course I am 
sorry to leave you. Why, you are the best mother 
in the whole world. But after all, as Lord Illing- 
worth says, it is impossible to live in such a place 
as Wrockley. You don't mind it. But I'm 
ambitious ; I want something more than that I 
want to have a career. I want to do something 
that will make you proud of me, and Lord Illing- 
worth is going to help me. He is going to do 
everything for me. 4 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Gerald, don't go away with Lord lUingworth, 
I Implore you not to. Gerald, I beg you ! 

IXI 



GERALD 

Mother, how changeable you are! You don't 
seem to know your own mind for a single moment. 
An hour and a half ago, in the Drawing-room, you 
agreed to the whole thing; now you turn round 
and make objections, and try to force me to give 
up my one chance in life. Yes, my one chance. 
You don't suppose that men like Lord Illingworth 
are to be found every day, do you, mother? It is 
very strange that when I have had such a wonder- 
ful piece of good luck, the one person to put 
difficulties in my way should be my own mother. 
Besides, you know, mother, I love Hester Worsley. 
Who could help loving her? I love her more 
than I have ever told you, far more. And if I 
had a position, if I had prospects, I could — I could 
ask her to — Don't you understand now, mother, 
what it means to me to be Lord Illingworth's 
secretary? To start like that is to find a career 
ready for one — before one — waiting for one. If 
I were Lord Illingworth's secretary, I could ask 
Hester to be my wife. As a wretched bank 
clerk, with a hundred a year, it would be an 
impertinence. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I fear you need have no hopes of Miss Worsley. 
I know her views on life. She has just told them 
to me. [A pause.l 

GERALD 

Then I have my ambition left, at any rate, 

HZ 



That is something — I am glad I have that ! You 
have always tried to crush my ambition, mother — 
haven't you? You have told me that the world 
is a wicked place, that success is not worth having, 
that society is shallow, and all that sort of thing 
— well, I don't believe it, mother. I think the 
world must be delightful. I think society must be 
exquisite. I think success is a thing worth 
having. You have been wrong in all that you 
taught me, mother, quite wrong. Lord lUing- 
worth is a successful man. He is a fashionable 
man. He is a man who lives in the world and 
for it Well, I would give anything to be just 
like Lord Illingworth. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I would sooner see you dead. 

GERALD 

Mother, what is your objection to Lord Illing- 
worth ? Tell me— tell me right out. What is it ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He is a bad man. 

GERALD 

In what way bad? I don't understand what 
you mean. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I will tell you. 

"3 Q 



GERALD 

I suppose you think him bad because he doesn't 
believe the same things as you do. Well, men 
are different from women, mother. It is natural 
that they should have different views. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It is not what Lord lUingworth believes, or 
what he does not believe, that makes him bad. 
It is what he is. 

GERALD 

Mother, is it something you know of him? 
Something you actually know? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It is something I know. 

GERALD 

Something you are quite sure of? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Quite sure of. 

GERALD 

How long have you known it ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

For twenty years. 

GERALD 

It is far to go back twenty years in any 

114 



man's career. And what have you or I to do 
with Lord lUingworth's early life? What busi- 
ness is it of ours ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

What this man has been, he is now, and will 
be always. 

GERALD 

Mother, tell me what Lord Illingworth did. If 
he did anything shameful, I will not go away with 
him. Surely you know me well enough for that ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Gerald, come near to me. Quite close to me, 
as you used to do when you were a little boy, 
when you were mother's own boy. [Gerald sits 
dawn beside his mother. She runs her fingers 
through his hair^ and strokes his hands.] Gerald, 
there was a girl once, she was very young, she 
was little over eighteen at the time. George 
Harford — that was Lord Illingworth's name then 
— George Harford met her. She knew nothing 
about life. He — knew everything. He made 
this girl love him. He made her love him 
so much that she left her father's house with 
him one morning. She loved him so much, and 
he had promised to marry her ! He had solemnly 
promised to marry her, and she had believed him. 
She was very young, and — and ignorant of what 
life really is. But he put the marriage off from 
week to week, and month to month. — She trusted 

"5 



in him all the while. She loved him. — Before her 
child was bom — for she had a child — she implored 
him for the child's sake to marry her, that the 
child might have a name, that her sin might not 
be visited on the child, who was innocent He 
refused. After the child was bom she left him, 
taking the child away, and her life was ruined, 
and her soul ruined, and all that was sweet, and 
good, and pure in her ruined also. She suffered 
terribly — ^she suffers now. She will always suffer. 
For her there is no joy, no peace, no atonement 
She is a woman who drags a chain like a guilty 
thing. She is a woman who wears a mask like 
a thing that is a leper. The fire cannot purify 
her. The waters cannot quench her anguish. 
Nothing can heal her! no anodyne can give her 
sleep ! no poppies forgetfulness ! She is lost ! 
She is a lost soul! — ^That is why I call Lord 
lUingworth a bad man. That is why I don't 
want my boy to be with him. 

GERALD 

My dear mother, it all sounds very tragic, of 
course, but I dare say the girl was just as much 
to blame as Lord Illingworth was. — After all, 
would a really nice girl, a girl with any nice 
feelings at all, go away from her home with a 
man to whom she was not married, and live 
with him as his wife ? No nice girl would. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[After a pause.] Gerald, I withdraw all my 

ii6 



objections. You are at liberty to go away with 
Lord lUingworth when and where you choose. 

GERALD 

Dear mother, I knew you wouldn't stand in my 
way. You are the best woman God ever made. 
And, as for Lord Illingworth, I don't believe he is 
capable of anything infamous or base^ I can't 
believe it of him — I can't. 

HESTER 

[Outside.] Let me go ! Let me go ! 

[Enter Hester in terror^ and rushes ever to 
Gerald and flings herself in his arms.] 

HESTER 

Oh ! save me — save me from him ! 

GERALD 

From whom ? 

HESTER 

He has insulted me! Horribly insulted me! 
Save me! 

GERALD 

Who ? Who has dared ? 

[Lord Illingworth enters at back of stage. Hester 
breaks from Gerald^ s arms and points to him.] 

117 



GERALD 

[He is quite beside himself with rage and indigna- 
tion^ Lord Illingworth, you have insulted the 
purest thing on God's earth, a thing as pure as my 
own mother. You have insulted the woman I love 
most in the world with my own mother. As there 
is a God in heaven, I will kill you I 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[Rushing across and catching hold of him.] No ! 
No! 

GERALD 

[Thrusting her back.] Don't hold me, mother. 
Don't hold me— I'll kill him ! 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Gerald ! 

GERALD 

Let me go, I say ! 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Stop, Gerald, stop ! He is your own father ! 

[Gerald clutches his mothet^s hands and looks into 
her face. She sinks slowly on the ground in shame. 
Hester steals towards the door. Lord lllingworth 
frowns and bites his lip. After a time^ Gerald 
raises his mother up ^ puts his arm round her^ and 
leads her from the room.]

FOURTH ACT 



Scene — Sitting-room at Mrs, Arbuthnofs, 
Large open French window at back^ looking on 
to garden. Doors R. C, and L, C. 

[Gerald Arbuthnot writing at table.] 

[Enter Alice, R, C.^ followed by Lady Hunstanton 
and Mrs. AUonby.] 

ALICE 

Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. AUonby. 

[Exit L. C] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Good morning, Gerald. 

GERALD 

[Rising] Good morning, Lady Hunstanton. 
Good morning, Mrs. AUonby. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

[Sitting down.] We came to enquire for your 
dear mother, Gerald. I hope she is better ? 

121 R 



GERALD 

My mother has not come down yet, Lady 
Hunstanton. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her 
last night I think there must have been thunder 
in the air. Or perhaps it was the music. Music 
makes one feel so romantic — at least it always 
gets on one's nerves. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

It's the same thing, now-a-days. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

I am so glad I don't know what you mean, dear. 
I am afraid you mean something wrong. Ah, I 
see you're examining Mrs. Arbuthnot's pretty 
room. Isn't it nice and old-fashioned? 

MRS. ALLONBY 

[Surveytng^ the room through her lorgnette^ It 
looks quite the happy English home. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

That's just the word, dear ; that just describes 
it One feels your mother's good influence in 
everything she has about her, Gerald. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Lord Illingworth says that all influence is bad, 

122 



but that a good influence is the worst in the 
world. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

When Lord lUingworth knows Mrs. Arbuthnot 
better, he will change his mind. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I should like to see Lord Illingworth in a happy 
English home. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

It would do him a great deal of good, dear. 
Most women in London, now-a-days, seem to 
furnish their rooms with nothing but orchids, 
foreigners, and French novels. But here we have 
the room of a sweet saint Fresh natural flowers, 
books that don't shock one, pictures that one can 
look at without blushing. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

But I like blushing. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Well, there is a good deal to be said for blush- 
ing, if one can do it at the proper moment Poor 
dear Hunstanton used to tell me I didn't blush 
nearly often enough. But then he was so very 
particular. He wouldn't let me know any of his 
men friends, except those who were over seventy, 

133 



like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the 
way, was brought into the Divorce Court A 
most unfortunate case. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I delight in men over seventy. They always 
offer one the devotion of a lifetime. I think 
seventy an ideal age for a man. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn*t she? By- 
the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will 
come and see me more often now. You and 
Lord lUingworth start almost immediately, don't 
you? 

GERALD 

I have given up my intention of being Lord 
Illingworth's secretary. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Surely not, Gerald ! It would be most unwise 
of you. What reason can you have? 

GERALD 

I don't think I should be suitable for the post 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I wish Lord lUingworth would ask me to be 
his secretary. But he says I am not serious 
enough. 

124 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear, you really mustn't talk like that in 
this house. Mrs. Arbuthnot doesn't know any- 
thing about the wicked society in which we all 
live. She won't go into it. She is far too good. 
I consider it was a great honour her coming to 
me last night. It gave quite an atmosphere of 
respectability to the party. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Ah, that must have been what you thought was 
thunder in the air. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

My dear, how can you say that ? There is no 
resemblance between the two things at all. But 
really, Gerald, what do you mean by not being 
suitable ? 

GERALD 

Lord Illingworth's views of life and mine are 
too different. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

But, my dear Gerald, at your age, you shouldn't 
have any views of life. They are quite out of 
place. You must be guided by others in this 
matter. Lord Illingworth has made you the most 
flattering offer, and travelling with him you would 
see the world — as much of it, at least, as one 
should look at — under the best auspices possible, 

125 



and stay with all the right people, which is so im- 
portant at this solemn moment in your career. 

GERALD 

I don't want to see the world : I've seen enough 
of it 

MRS. ALLONBY 

I hope you don't think you have exhausted life, 
Mr. Arbuthnot When a man says that, one knows 
that life has exhausted him. 

GERALD 

I don't wish to leave my mother. 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Now, Gerald, that is pure laziness on your part. 
Not leave your mother! If I were your mother I 
would insist on your going. 

[Enter Alice L. C] 

ALICE 

Mrs. Arbuthnot's compliments, my lady, but 
she has a bad headache, and cannot see anyone 
this morning. 

[Exit R. C] 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

A bad headache! I am so sorry! Perhaps 
you'll bring her up to Hunstanton this after- 
noon, if she is better, Gerald. 

126 



GERALD 

I am afraid not this afternoon, Lady Hunstanton, 

LADY HUNSTANTON 

Well, to-morrow, then. Ah! if you had a 
father, he wouldn't let you waste your life here. 
He would send you off with Lord Illingworth at 
once. But mothers are so weak. They give up 
to their sons in everything. We are all heart, all 
heart Come, dear, I must call at the rectory 
and enquire for Mrs. Daubeny, who, I am afraid, 
is far from well. It is wonderful how the Arch- 
deacon bears up, quite wonderful. He is the most 
sympathetic of husbands. Quite a model. Good- 
bye, Gerald. Give my fondest love to your mother. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Good-bye, Mr. Arbuthnot. 

GERALD 

Good-bye. 

[Ext^ Lady Hunstanton and Mrs. Allonby. 
Gerald sits down and reads over his letter^ 

GERALD 

What name can I sign ? I, who have no right 
to any name. \Signs name^ puts letter into envelope^ 
addresses it, and is about to seal it, when door L. C. 
opens, and Mrs, Arbuthnot enters. Gerald lays 
down sealing wax. Mother and son look at each 
other.] 

127 



LADY HUNSTANTON 

[Through French window at dock.] Good-bye 
again, Gerald. We are taking the short cut 
across your pretty garden. Now remember my 
advice to you — start at once with Lord lUingworth. 

MRS. ALLONBY 

Au revoir, Mr. Arbuthnot. Mind you bring me 
back something nice from your travels — not an 
Indian shawl — on no account an Indian shawl. 

[Exeunt.'] 

GERALD 

Mother, I have just written to him. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

To whom? 

GERALD 

To my father. I have written to tell him to 
come here at four o'clock this afternoon. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He shall not come here. He shall not cross the 
threshold of my house. 

GERALD 

He must come. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Gerald, if you are going away with Lord lUing- 

128 



worth, go at once. Go before it kills me: but 
don't ask me to meet him. 

GERALD 

Mother, you don't understand. Nothing in the 
world would induce me to go away with Lord 
Illingworth, or to leave you. Surely you know 
me well enough for that No : I have written 
to him to say 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

What can you have to say to him ? 

GERALD 

Can't you guess, mother, what I have written 
in this letter? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

No. 

GERALD 

Mother, surely you can. Think, think what 
must be done, now, at once, within the next few 
days. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

There is nothing to be done. 

GERALD 

I have written to Lord Illingworth to tell him 
that he must marry you. 

129 s 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Marry me? 

GERALD 

Mother, I will force him to do it. The wrong 
that he has done you must be repaired. Atone- 
ment must be made. Justice may be slow, 
mother, but it comes in the end. In a few days 
you shall be Lord Illingworth's lawful wife. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

But, Gerald 

GERALD 

I will insist upon his doing it I will make him 
do it : he will not dare to refuse. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

But, Gerald, it is I who refuse. I will not marry 
Lord Illingworth. 

GERALD 

Not marry him ? Mother ! 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I will not marry him. 

GERALD 

But you don't understand : it is for your sake 
I am talking, not for mine. This marriage, this 

130 



necessary marriage, this marriage that, for obvious 
reasons, must inevitably take place, will not help 
me, will not give me a name that will be really 
rightly mine to bear. But surely it will be some- 
thing for you, that you, my mother, should, how- 
ever late, become the wife of the man who is my 
father. Will not that be something ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I will not marry him. 

GERALD 

Mother, you must. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I will not. You talk of atonement for a wrong 
done. What atonement can be made to me? 
There is no atonement possible. I am disgraced : 
he is not. That is all. It is the usual history 
of a man and a woman, as it usually happens, as it 
always happens. And the ending is the ordinary 
ending. The woman suffers. The man goes free. 

GERALD 

I don't know if that is the ordinary ending, 
mother : I hope it is not. But your life, at any 
rate, shall not end like that. The man shall make 
whatever reparation is possible. It is not enough. 
It does not wipe out the past, I know that. But 
at least it makes the future better, better for you, 
mother. 

131 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I refuse to marry Lord IlHngworth. 

GERALD 

If he came to you himself and asked you to 
be his wife you would give him a different answer. 
Remember he is my father. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

If he came himself, which he will not do, my 
answer would be the same. Remember, I am 
your mother. 

GERALD 

Mother, you make it terribly difficult for me by 
talking like that, and I can't understand why you 
won't look at this matter from the right, from 
the only proper standpoint. It is to take away the 
bitterness out of your life, to take away the shadow 
that lies on your name, that this marriage must 
take place. There is no alternative : and after the 
marriage you and I can go away together. But 
the marriage must take place first. It is a duty 
that you owe, not merely to yourself, but to all 
other women — yes : to all the other women in 
the world, lest he betray more. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I owe nothing to other women. There is not 
one of them to help me. There is not one woman 
in the world to whom I could go for pity, if I 

132 



would take it, or for sympathy, if I could win 
it. Women are hard on each other. That girl 
last night, good though she is, fled from the room 
as though I were a tainted thing. She was right 
I am a tainted thing. But my wrongs are my 
own, and I will bear them alone. I must bear 
them alone. What have women who have not 
sinned to do with me, or I with them? We do 
not understand each other. 

[Enter Hester behind^ 

GERALD 

I implore you to do what I ask you. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

What son has ever asked of his mother to make 
so hideous a sacrifice ? None. 

GERALD 

What mother has ever refused to marry the 
father of her own child ? None. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Let me be the first then. I will not do it. 

GERALD 

Mother, you believe in religion, and you brought 
me up to believe in it also. Well, surely your 
religion, the religion that you taught me when I 
was a boy, mother, must tell you that I am right. 
You know it, you feel it. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I do not know it I do not feel it, nor will I 

133 



ever stand before God's altar, and ask God's 
blessing on so hideous a mockery as a marriage 
between me and Geoi^e Harford. I will not say 
the words the Church bids us to say. I will not 
say them. I dare not How could I swear to 
love the man I loathe, to honour him who wrought 
you dishonour, to obey him who, in his mastery, 
made me to sin? No: marriage is a sarcament 
for those who love each other. It is not for such 
as him, nor such as me. Gerald, to save you from 
the world's sneers and taunts, I have lied to the 
world. For twenty years I have lied to the world. 
I could not tell the world the truth. Who can, 
ever ? But not for my own sake will I lie to God, 
and in God's presence. No, Gerald, no ceremony. 
Church-hallowed or State-made, shall ever bind 
me to George Harford. It may be that I am too 
bound to him already, who, robbing me, yet left 
me richer, so that in the mire of my life, I found 
the pearl of price, or what I thought would be so. 

GERALD 

I don't understand you now. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Men don't understand what mothers are. I am 
no different from other women except in the 
wrong done me and the wrong I did, and my very 
heavy punishments and great disgrace. And yet 
to bear you I had to look on death. To nurture 
you I had to wrestle with it. Death fought with 
me for you. All women have to fight with death 

134 



to keep their children. Death, being childless, 
wants our children from us. Gerald, when you 
were naked I clothed you, when you were hungry 
I gave you food. Night and day all that long 
winter I tended you. No office is too mean, no 
care too lowly for the thing we women love — and 
oh! how / loved you. Not Hannah Samuel 
more. And you needed love, for you were weakly, 
and only love could have kept you alive. Only 
love can keep anyone alive. And boys are care- 
less often, and without thinking give pain, and we 
always fancy that when they come to man's 
estate, and know us better, they will repay us. 
But it is not so. The world draws them from our 
side, and they make friends with whom they 
are happier than they are with us, and have 
amusements from which we are barred, and 
interests that are not ours: and they are unjust 
to us often, for when they find life bitter they 
blame us for it, and when they find it sweet we do 
not taste its sweetness with them. . . . You made 
many friends and went into their houses and were 
glad with them, and I, knowing my secret, did 
not dare to follow, but stayed at home and closed 
the door, shut out the sun, and sat in darkness. 
What should I have done in honest households? 
My past was ever with me. . . . And you thought 
I didn't care for the pleasant things of life. I tell 
you I longed for them, but did not dare to 
touch them, feeling I had no right. You thought 
I was happier working amongst the poor. That 
was my mission, you imagined. It was not, but 

135 



where else was I to go ? The sick do not ask if 
the hand that smooths their pillow is pure, nor 
the dying care if the lips that touch their brow 
have known the kiss of sin. It was you I thought 
of all the time ; I gave to them the love you did 
not need : lavished on them a love that was not 
theirs. . . . And you thought I spent too much 
of my time in going to Church, and in Church 
duties. But where else could I turn ? God's house 
is the only house where sinners are made welcome, 
and you were always in my heart, Gerald, too 
much in my heart. For, though day after day, at 
morn or evensong, I have knelt in Grod's house, I 
have never repented of my sin. How could I 
repent of my sin when you, my love, were its 
fruit? Even now that you are bitter to me, I 
cannot repent. I do not You are more to me 
than innocence. I would rather be your mother 
— oh! much rather! — than have been always 
pure. . . . Oh, don't you see ? don't you under- 
stand ? It is my dishouour that has made you so 
dear to me. It is my disgrace that has bound 
you so closely to me. It is the price I paid for 
you — the price of soul and body — that makes me 
love you as I do. Oh, don't ask me to do this 
horrible thing. Child of my shame, be still the 
child of my shame. 

GERALD 

Mother, I didn't know you loved me so much 
as that. And I will be a better son to you than I 
have been. And you and I must never leave 

136 



each other . . . but, mother . . • I can't help 
it . . . you must become my father's wife. You 
must marry him. It is your duty. 

HESTER 

[Running forward and embracing Mrs, Arbuth- 
not.] No, no ; you shall not. That would be real 
dishonour, the first you have ever known. That 
would be real disgrace, the first to touch you. 
Leave him and come with me. There are other 
countries than England. . . . Oh ! other countries 
over sea, better, wiser, and less unjust lands. The 
world is very wide and very big. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

No, not for me. For me the world is shrivelled 
to a palm's breadth, and where I walk there are 
thorns. 

HESTER 

It shall not be so. We shall somewhere find 
green valleys and fresh waters, and if we weep, 
well, we shall weep together. Have we not both 
loved him ? 

GERALD 

Hester ! 

HESTER 

[Waving him back,] Don't, don't! You can- 
not love me at all, unless you love her also. You 

137 T 



cannot honour me, unless she's holier to you. In 
her all womanhood is martyred. Not she alone, 
but all of us are stricken in her house. 

GERALD 

Hester, Hester, what shall I do ? 

HESTER 

Do you respect the man who is your father ? 

GERALD 

Respect him? I despise him! He is in- 
famous. 

HESTER 

I thank you for saving me from him last night. 

GERALD 

Ah, that is nothing. I would die to save you. 
But you don't tell me what to do now ! 

HESTER 

Have I not thanked you for saving me ? 

GERALD 

But what should I do ? 

HESTER 

Ask your own heart, not mine. I never had a 
mother to save, or shame. 

138 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He is hard — ^he is hard. Let me go away. 

GERALD 

[Rushes over and kneels down beside his mother^ 
Mother, forgive me : I have been to blame. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Don't kiss my hands : they are cold. My heart 
is cold : something has broken it. 

HESTER 

Ah, don't say that. Hearts live by being 
wounded. Pleasure may turn a heart to stone, 
riches may make it callous, but sorrow — oh, 
sorrow cannot break it Besides, what sorrows 
have you now? Why, at this moment you are 
more dear to him than ever, dear though you 
have been^ and oh! how dear you have been 
always. Ah ! be kind to him. 

GERALD 

You are my mother and my father all in one. 
I need no second parent. It was for you I spoke, 
for you alone. Oh, say something, mother. Have 
I but found one love to lose another ? Don't tell 
me that. O mother, you are cruel. \Gets up 
and flings himself sobbing on a so/a,] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[To Hester.] But has he found indeed another 
love? 

139 



HESTER 

You know I have loved him always. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

But we are very poor. 

HESTER 

Who, being loved, is poor? Oh, no one. I 
hate my riches. They are a burden. Let him 
share it with me. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

But we are disgraced. We rank among the 
outcasts. Gerald is nameless. The sins of the 
parents should be visited on the children. It is 
God's law. 

HESTER 

I was wrong. God's law is only Love. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[Rises, and taking Hester by the hand, goes slowly 
over to where Gerald is lying on the sofa with his 
head buried in his hands. She touches him and he 
looks up.] Gerald, I cannot give you a father, but 
I have brought you a wife. 

GERALD 

Mother, I am not worthy either of her or you. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

So she comes first, you are worthy. And when 

140 



you are away, Gerald . . . with . . , her — oh, 
think of me sometimes. Don't forget me. And 
when you pray, pray for me. We should pray 
when we are happiest, and you will be happy, 
Gerald. 

HESTER 

Oh, you don't think of leaving us ? 

GERALD 

Mother, you won't leave us ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I might bring shame upon you ! 

GERALD 

Mother ! 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

For a little then : and if you let me, near you 
always. 

HESTER 

[To Mrs, Arbuthnot.'\ Come out with us to the 
garden. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Later on, later on. 

[Exeunt Hester and Gerald.] 

[Mrs. Arbuthnot goes towards door L, C. Stops 
at looking-glass over mantelpiece and looks into iV.] 

[Enter Alice R. C] 

141 



ALICE 

A gentleman to see you, ma'am. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Say I am not at home. Show me the card. 
[Takes card from salver and looks at it] Say I 
will not see him. 

[Lord Illingworth enters. Mrs. Arbuthnot sees 
him in the glass and starts^ but does not turn round. 
Exit Alice.] 

What can you have to say to me to-day, George 
Harford? You can have nothing to say to me. 
You must leave this house. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Rachel, Gerald knows everything about you 
and me now, so some arrangement must be come 
to that will suit us all three. I assure you, he 
will find in me the most charming and generous 
of fathers. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

My son may come in at any moment. I saved 
you last night. I may not be able to save you 
again. My son feels my dishonour strongly, 
terribly strongly. I beg you to go. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

[Sitting down.] Last night was excessively 
unfortunate. That silly Puritan girl making a 
scene merely because I wanted to kiss her. What 
harm is there in a kiss? 

142 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[Tumin£^ round,] A kiss may ruin a human 
life, George Harford. / know that / know that 
too well. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

We won't discuss that at present. What is of 
importance to-day, as yesterday, is still our son. 
I am extremely fond of him, as you know, and 
odd though it may seem to you, I admired his 
conduct last night immensely. He took up the 
cudgels for that pretty prude with wonderful 
promptitude. He is just what I should have 
liked a son of mine to be. Except that no son of 
mine should ever take the side of the Puritans : 
that is always an error. Now what I propose is 
this. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Lord lUingworth, no proposition of yours in- 
terests me. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

According to our ridiculous English laws,/ I 
can't legitimise Gerald. But I can leave him my 
property. Illingworth is entailed, of course, but it 
is a tedious barrack of a place. He can have 
Ashby, which is much prettier. Harborough, which 
has the best shooting in the north of England, and 
the house in St. James Square. What more can a 
gentleman desire in this world? 

143 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Nothing more, I am quite sure. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

As for a title, a title is really rather a nuisance 
in these democratic days. As George Harford I 
had everything I wanted. Now I have merely 
everything that other people want, which isn't 
nearly so pleasant, Well, my proposal is this. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT * 

I told you I was not interested, and I beg you 
to go. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

The boy is to be with you for six months in the 
year, and with me for the other six. That is per- 
fectly fair, is it not? You can have whatever 
allowance you like, and live where you choose. 
As for your past no one knows anything about it 
except myself and Gerald. There is the Puritan, 
of course the Puritan in white muslin, but she 
doesn't count. She couldn't tell the story without 
explaining that she objected to being kissed, could 
she ? And all the women would think her a fool 
and the men think her a bore. And you need not 
be afraid that Grerald won't be my heir. I 
needn't tell you I have not the slightest intention 

of marrying. 

144 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

You come too late. My son has no need of 
you. You are not necessary. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What do you mean, Rachel ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

That you are not necessary to Gerald's career. 
He does not require you. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I do not understand you. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Look into the garden. [Lord lllingworth rises 
and goes towards window.] You had better not 
let them see you : you bring unpleasant memories. 
[Lord lllingworth looks out and starts.] She loves 
him. They love each other. We are safe from 
you, and we are going away. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Where ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

We will not tell you, and if you find us we will 
not know you. You seem surprised. What wel- 
come would you get from the girl whose lips you 

145 u 



tried to soil, from the boy whose life you have 
shamed, from the mother whose dishonour comes 
from you? 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You have grown hard, Rachel. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I was too weak once. It is well for me that I 
have changed. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I was very young at the time. We men know 
life too early. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

And we women know life too late. That is the 
difference between men and women. [A pause,] 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Rachel, I want my son. My money may be of 
no use to him now. I may be of no use to him, 
but I want my son. Bring us together, Rachel. 
You can do it if you choose. [Sees Utter on table.] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

There is no room in my boy's life for j^ou. He 
is not interested in j/ou. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Then why does he write to me ? 

146 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

What do you mean. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What letter is this ? [ Takes up letter^ 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

That — is nothing. Give it to me. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is addressed to me. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

You are not to open it. I forbid you to open it. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

And in Gerald's handwriting. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It was not to have been sent. It is a letter 
he wrote to you this morning before he saw me. 
But he is sorry now he wrote it, very sorry. You 
are not to open it. Give it to me. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It belongs to me. \ppens it^ sits down and reads 
it slowly. Mrs. Arbuthnot watches him all the 
time.] You have read this letter, I suppose, 
Rachel ? 

147 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

No. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

You know what is in it ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Yes! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I don't admit for a moment that the boy is 
right in what he says. I don't admit that it is any 
duty of mine to marry you. I deny it entirely. 
But to get my son back I am ready — yes^ I am 
ready to marry you, Rachel — and to treat you 
always with the deference and respect due to my 
wife. I will marry you as soon as you choose. I 
give you my word of honour. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

You made that promise to me once before, and 
broke it. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I will keep it now. And that will show you 
that I love my son, at least as much as you love 
him. For when I marry you, Rachel, there are 
some ambitions I shall have to surrender. High 
ambitions too, if any ambition is high. 

148 



MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I decline to marry you, Lord Illingworthr 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Are you serious ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Yes. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Do tell me your reasons. They would interest 
me enormously. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

I have already explained them to my son. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I suppose they were intensely sentimental, 
weren't they ? You women live by your emotions 
and for them. You have no philosophy of life. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

You are right. We women live by our emo- 
tions and for them. By our passions and for 
them, if you will. I have two passions. Lord 
Illingworth : my love of him, my hate of you. 
You cannot kill those. They feed each other. 

149 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What sort of love is that which needs to have 
hate as its brother? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It is the sort of love I have for Gerald. Do you 
think that terrible ? Well, it is terrible. All love 
is terrible. All love is a tragedy. I loved you 
once, Lord Illingworth. Oh, what a tragedy for a 
woman to have loved you ! 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

So you really refuse to marry me ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Yes. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

Because you hate me ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Yes. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

And does my son hate me as you do ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

No. 

ISO 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

I am glad of that, Rachel. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

He merely despises you. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What a pity ! what a pity for him, I mean. 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Don't be deceived, George. Children begin by 
loving their parents. After a time they judge 
them. Rarely if ever do they forgive them. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

[Reads letter over again very slowly^ May I 
ask by what arguments you made the boy who 
wrote this letter, this beautiful passionate letter, 
believe that you should not marry his father, the 
father of your own child ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

It was not I who made him see it. It was 
another. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

What fin-de-si^cle person ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

The Puritan, Lord lUingworth. 

\A pause.] 



LORD ILLINGWORTH 

[ Winces, then rises slowly and goes over to table 
where his hat and gloves are. Mrs. Arbuthnot is 
standing close to the table. He picks up one of the 
gloves and begins putting it on.] There is not 
much for me then to do here, Rachel ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

Nothing. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

It is good-bye, is it ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

For- ever, this time, I hope. Lord Illingworth. 

LORD ILLINGWORTH 

How curious ! At this moment you look 
exactly as you looked the night you left me 
twenty years ago. You have just the same ex- 
pression in your mouth. Upon my word, Rachel, 
no woman ever loved me as you did. Why you 
gave yourself to me like a flower, to do anything 
I liked with. You were the prettiest of play- 
things, the most fascinating of small romances. 
. . . [Pulls out watch.] Quarter to two ! Must be 
strolling back to Hunstanton. Don't suppose I 
shall see you there again. Pm sorry. I am 
really. It's been an amusing experience to have 
met amongst people of one's own rank, and 



treated quite seriously too, one's mistress and 
one's 

[Mrs. Arbuthnot snatches up glove and strikes 
Lord Illingworth across the face with it Lord 
Illingworth starts. He is dazed by the insult of 
his punishment^ then he controls himself and goes 
to window y and looks out at his son. Sighs and 
leaves room.] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[Falls sobbing on sofa.] He would have said it. 
He would have said it. 

[Enter Gerald and Hester from garden^ 

GERALD 

Well, dear mother. You never came out after 
all, so we have come in to fetch you. Mother, 
you have not been crying? [Kneels down beside 
her.] 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

My boy ! My boy ! My boy ! [Running her 
fingers through his hair.] 

HESTER 

[Coming over.] But you have two children now. 
You'll let me be your daughter ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[Looking up.] Would you choose me for a 
mother ? 

153 X 



HESTER 

You of all women I ever knew. 

[TAey move towards door leading into garden^ 
with their arms round each other's waists, Gerald 
goes to table L. C. for his hat. On turning round 
he sees Lord IllingwortHs glove lying on floor and 
picks it up.] 

GERALD 

Hallo, mother, whose glove is this ? You have 
had a visitor. Who was it ? 

MRS. ARBUTHNOT 

[Turning round.] Oh ! no one. No one in 
particular — A man of no importance. 



Curtain.
