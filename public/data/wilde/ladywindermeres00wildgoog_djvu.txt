LADY WINDERMERE 

How do you do, Lord Darlington? No, I 
can't shake hands with you. My hands are all 
wet with these roses. Aren't they lovely ? They 
came up from Selby this morning. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

They are quite perfect. [Sees a fan lying on

It's my husband's birthday present to me. You

LADY WINDERMERE 

Well, you kept paying me elaborate compli-

LORD DARLINGTON 

[Smiling.] Ah, now-a-days we are all of us so 
bard up, that the only pleasant things to pay 
are compliments. They're the only things we can 
pay. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

{Shaking her head.] No, I am talking very 
seriously. You mustn't laugh, I am quite serious, 
I don't like compliments, and I don't see why 
a man should think he is pleasing a woman 
enormously when he says to her a whole heap 
of things that he doesn't mean.

LADY WINDERMERE 

[Gravefy.] I hope not. I should be sorry to 
have to quarrel with you, Lord Darlington. I 
like you very much, you know that But I 
shouldn't like you at all if I thought you were 
what most other men are. Believe me, you are 
better than most other men, and I sometimes 
think you pretend to be worse. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

We all have our little vanities, Lady Winder- 
mere. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Why do you make that your special one? 
[StiU seated at table Z.] 
LORD DARLINGTON 

\Still seated L. C] Oh, now-a-days so many 
conceited people go about Society pretending to , 
be good, that I think it shows rather a sweet i 
and modest disposition to pretend to be bad. 
Besides, there is this to be said. If you pretend \ 
to be good, the world takes you very seriously. 
If you pretend to be bad, it doesn't. Such is 
the astounding stupidity of optimism. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Don't you want the world to take you seriously 
then. Lord Darlington ?

LORD DARLINGTON 

No, not the world. Who are the people the 
world takes seriously? All the dull people one 
can think of, from the Bishops down to the 
bores. I should like j'ou to take me very seriously, 
Lady Windermere, you more than any one else 
in life. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Why — why me ? 
LORD DARLINGTON 

[After a slight Aesiiatica.] Because I think we 
might be great friends. Let us be great friends. 
You may want a friend some day. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Why do you say that ? 
LORD DARLINGTON 
Oh ! — we all want friends at times, 

LADY WINDERMERE 

I think we're very good friends already, Lord 
Darlington. We can always remain so as long

Well, I have something of the Puritan in me. I 
was brought up like that. I am glad of it. My 
mother died when 1 was a mere child. I lived 
always with Lady Julia, my father's eldest sister, 
you know. She was stern to me, but she taught 
me, what the world is foi^etting, the difference 
that there is between what is right and what is 
wrong. She allowed of no compromise. J allow 
of none.

LADY WINDERMERE 

Yes. Now-a-days people seem to look on 
life as a speculation. It is not a speculation. 
It is a sacrament Its ideal is Love. Its 
purification is sacrifice.

You don't think it will rain, Lord Darlington,

LORD DARLINGTON 

I won't hear of its raining on your birthday ! 
LADY WINDERMERE 

Tell them to do it at once, Parker. 

[Exit Parker C] 
LORD DARLINGTON 

[Still seated^ Do you think then — of course I 
am only putting an imaginary instance — do you 
think, that in the case of a young married couple, 
say about two years married, if the husband 
suddenly becomes the intimate friend of a woman 
of — well, more than doubtful character, is always 
calling upon her, lunching with her, and probably

paying her bills — do you think that the wife 
should not console herself 7 

LADV WINDERMERE 

[FroTvniftg^.] Console herself? 

LORD DARUNGTON 

Yes, I think she should — I think she has the 
right 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Because the husband is vile — should the wife 
be vile also ? 

LORD DARLINGTON 

Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

It is a terrible thing. Lord Darlington. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

Do you know I am afraid that good people 
do a great deal of harm in this world Certainly 
the greatest harm they do is that they make 
badness of such extraordinary importance. It 
is absurd to divide people into good and bad.'\ 
People are either charming or tedious. I take 
the side of the charming, and you, Lady 
Windermere, can't help belonging to them.

LADY WINDERMERE 

Now, Lord Darlington [Rising and crossing R., 
front of him.'] Don't stir, I am merely going 
to finish my flowers. [Goes to table R. C] 

LORD DARLINGTON 

[Rising and moving chair.] And I must say 
I think you are very hard on modem life, Lady 
Windermere. Of course there is much against 
it, I admit Most women, for instance, now-a- 
days, are rather mercenary. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Don't talk about such people. 
LORD DARLINGTON 

Well then, setting mercenary people aside, 
who, of course, are dreadful, do you think 
seriously that women who have committed what 
the world calls a fault should never be forgiven ? 

LADY WINDERMERE 

[Standing at icUiU.] 1 think they should 
never be forgiven. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

And me? Do you think that there should 
be the same laws for men as there are for 
women P 

LADY WINDERMERE 
Certainly !

LORD DARLINGTON 

I think life too complex a thing to be settled 
by these hard and fast rules. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

If we had 'these hard and fast rules,' we 
should find life much more simple. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

You allow of no exceptions ? 
LADY WINDERMERE 

None ! 
LORD DARLINGTON 

Ah, what a fascinating Puritan you are, Lady 
Windermere ! 

LADY WINDERMERE 

The adjective was unnecessary, Lord Dar- 
lington. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

I couldn't help it I can resist everything 
except temptation.

How do you do. Lord Darlington 7 I won't let 
you know my daughter, you are far too wicked. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

Don't say that, Duchess. As a wicked man 
1 am a complete failure. Why, there are lots of 
people who say I have never really done any- 
thing wrong in the whole course of my life. Of 
course they only say it behind my back,

But we are positively getting elbowed into the

existence if we didn't nag at them from time to 
time, just to remind them that we have a perfect 
legal right to do so. 

LORD DARLINGTON 

It's a curious thing, Duchess, about the game 
of marriage — a game, by the way, that is going 
out of fashion — the wives hold all the honours, 
and invariably lose the odd trick. 

DUCHESS OF BERWICK 

The odd trick? Is that the husband, I^rd

husband.

LADY WINDERMERE 

But what is it. Duchess ? Why do you talk 
to me about this person ? 

DUCHESS OF BERWICK 

Don't you really know? I assure you we're 
all so distressed about it. Only last night at 
dear Lady Fansen's every one was saying how 
extraordinary it was that, of all men in London, 
Windermere should behave in such a way. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

My husband — what has ke got to do with any 
woman of that kind ? 

DUCHESS OF BERWICK 

Ah, what indeed, dear? That is the point. 
He goes to see her continually, and stops for 
hours at a time, and while he is there she is not 
at home to any one. Not that many ladies call 
on her, dear, but she has a great many disre- 
putable men friends — my own brother in par- 
ticular, as I told you — and that is what makes 
it so dreadful about Windermere. We looked 
upon him as being such a model husband, but 
I am afraid there is no doubt about it My 
dear nieces — you know the Saville girls, don't 
you ? — such nice domestic creatures — plain, dread- 
fully plain, but so good — well, they're always at 
the window doing fancy work, and making ugly 
things for the poor, which I think so useful of 
them in these dreadful socialistic days, and this 
terrible woman has taken a house in Curzon

Street, right opposite them — such a respectable 
street, too. I don't know what we're coming to ! 
And they tell me that Windermere goes there 
four and five times a week — they see him. They 
can't help it — and although they never talk 
scandal, they — well, of course — they remark on it 
to every one. And the worst of it all is, that 
I have been told that this woman has got a great 
deal of money out of somebody, for it seems 
that she came to London six months ago with- 
out anything at all to speak of, and now she 
has this charming house in Mayfair, drives her 
pony in the Park every afternoon, and all — well 
all — since she has known poor dear Windermere. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Oh, I can't believe it ! 
DUCHESS OF BERWICK 

But it's quite true, my dear. The whole of 
London knows it That is why I felt it was 
better to come and talk to you, and advise you 
to take Windermere away at once to Homburg 
or to Aix, where hell have something to amuse 
him, and where you can watch him all day long. 
I assure you, my dear, that on several occasions 
after I was ^rst married I had to pretend to be 
very ill, and was obliged to drink the most un- 
pleasant mineral waters, merely to get Berwick 
out of town. He was so extremely susceptible. 
Though I am bound to say he never gave away / 
any lai^e sums of money to anybody. He is far/ 
too high-principled for that.

every colour, every shape, every material. In 
fact, before the honeymoon was over, I caught 
him winking at my maid, a most pretty, respect-

character, — No, I remember I passed her on to 
my sister; poor dear Sir Geoi^e is so short-

down again.} And by the way, I must thank 
you for sending a card to Mr. Hopper — he's 
that rich young Australian, people are taking 
such notice of just at present. His father made 
a great fortune by selling some kind of food 
in circular tins — most palatable, I believe— I 
fancy it is the thing the servants always refuse 
to eat But the son is quite interesting. I 
think he's attracted by dear Agatha's clever 
talk. Of course, we should be very sorry to 
lose her, but I think that a mother who doesn't 
part with a daughter every season has no real 
affection. We're coming to-night, dear. [Parker

How horrible t I understand now what Lord 
Darlington meant by the imf^inary instance 
of the couple not two years married. Oh ! it 
can't be true — she spoke of enormous sums of 
money paid to this woman. I know where 
Arthur keeps his bank book — in one of 
the drawers of that desk. I might find out by

LORD WINDERMERE 

I think it wrong that a wife should spy on 
her husband. 



LADY WINDERMERE 

I did not spy on you. I never knew of this 
woman's existence till half an hour ago. Some 
one who pitied me was kind enough to tell me

daily visits to Curzon Street, your mad infatuation, 
the monstrous sums of money you squander 
on this infamous woman ! [Crossing L.]

LORD WINDERMERE 

I am not going to give you any details about 
her life. I tell you simply this — Mrs. Erlynne 
was once honoured, loved, respected. She was 
well bom, she had a position — she lost every- 
thing — threw it away, if you like. That makes 
it all the more bitter. Misfortunes one can 
endure — they come from outside, they are acci- 
dents. But to suffer for one's own faults — ah ! 
there is the sting of life. It was twenty years 
ago, too. She was little more than a girl then. 
She had been a wife for even less time than 
you have.

been to several houses — not to houses where you 
would go, I admit, but still to houses where 
women who are in what is called Society now- 
a-days do go. That does not content her. She 
wants you to receive her once.

No ; but because she knows that you are a 
good woman — and that if she comes here once 
she will have a chance of a happier, a surer life, 
than she has had. She will make no further 
effort to know you. Won't you help a woman 
who is tryii^ to get back ?

wishes to return to the society that has made or

You should have ! 

LORD DARLINGTON 

I couldn't 1 A man can't tell these things

I think I would have told you. That insult, at 
any rate, you would have been spared. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

I did not ask her. He insisted on her coming 
— against my entreaties — against my commands. 
Oh! the house is tainted for me! I feel that 
every woman here sneers at me as she dances 
by with my husband. What have I done to 
deserve this? I gave him all my life. He took 
it — used it — spoiled it! I am degraded in my

moment of the day. You would feel that the 
look in his eyes was false, his voice false, his 
touch false, his passion false. He would come 
to you when he was weary of others ; you would 
have to comfort him. He would come to you 
when he was devoted to others ; you would have 
to charm htm. You would have to be to him 
the mask of his real life, the cloak to hide his 
secret

it that you are here? Who told you I had left 
the house you were shameless enough to enter? 
Who told you where 1 had gone to ? My 
husband told you, and sent you to decoy me 
back. [Crosses Z..]

[ Tears it and throws it into the fire.] 

LADY WINDERMERE 

[With infinite contempt in her voice and looi.^ 
How do I know that that was my letter after 
all? You seem to think the commonest device 
can take me in 1 

MRS. ERLYNNE 

Oh ! why do you disbelieve everything I tell 
you ? What object do you think I have in coming 
here, except to save you from utter ruin, to save 
you from the consequence of a hideous mistake ? 
That letter that is burning now v/as your letter. 
I swear it to you 1 

LADY WINDERMERE

the truth about anything ? [Sits down.]

[SuiUnly.] I do not love him 1 
MRS. ERLYNNE 

You do, and you know that he loves you. 
LADY WINDERMERE 

He does not understand what love is. He 
understands it as little as you do — but I see 
what you want It would be a great advantage 
for you to get me back. Dear Heaven ! what a 
life I would have then ! Living at the mercy of 
a woman who has neither mercy nor pity in her, 
a woman whom it is an infamy to meet, a degra- 
dation to know, a vile woman, a woman who 
comes between husband and wife ! 

MRS. ERLYNNE 

[IViiA a gesture of despair.} Lady Winder- 
mere, Lady Windermere, don't say such terrible 
things. You don't know how terrible they are, 
how terrible and how unjust. Listen, you must 
listen I Only go back to your husband, and I 
promise you never to communicate with him 
again on any pretext — never to see him — never 
to have anything to do with his life or yours. 
The money that he gave me, he gave me not 
through love, but through hatred, not in worship, 
but in contempt The hold I have over him

MRS. ERLVNNE 

Yes, and I will tell you what it ts. It is his 
love for you, Lady Windermere. 

LADY WINDERMERE 
You expect me to believe that ? 

MRS. ERLVNNE 

You must believe it I It is true. It is his love 
for you that has made him submit to — oh ! call 
it what you like, tyranny, threats, anything you 
choose. But it is his love for you. His desire 
to spare you — shame, yes, shame and disgrace. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

What do you mean 7 You are insolent ! What 
have I to do with you ? 

MRS. ERLVNNE 

IHumdlj/.] Nothing. I know it — but I tell you 
that your husband loves you — that you may 
never meet with such love again in your whole 
life — that such love you will never meet — and that 
if you throw it away, the day may come when 
you will starve for love and it will not be given 
to you, beg for love and it will be denied you —

abandoned, sneered at — to be an outcast I to find 
the door shut against one, to have to creep in by 
hideous byways, afraid every moment lest the 
mask should be stripped from one's face, and all 
the while to hear the laughter, the horrible 
laughter of the world, a thing more tragic than 
all the tears the world has ever shed. You don't

pass. I may have wrecked my own life, but I 
will not let you wreck yours. You — why, you 
are a mere girl, you would be lost You haven't 
got the kind of brains that enables a woman to 
get back. You have neither the wit nor the 
courage. You couldn't stand dishonour. No I 
Go back, Lady Windermere, to the husband who 
loves you, whom you love. You have a child. 
Lady Windermere. Go back to that child who 
even now, in pain or in joy, may be calling to 
you. [Lady Windermere rises.'\ God gave you 
that child. He will require from you that you 
make his life fine, that you watch over him. 
What answer will you make to God if his life is 
ruined through you ? Back to your house, Lady 
Windermere — your husband loves you. He has 
never swerved for a moment from the love he 
bears you. But even if he had a thousand loves, 
you must stay with your child. If he was harsh 
to you, you must stay with your child. If he ill- 
treated you, you must stay with your child. If 
he abandoned you, your place is with your child.

Yes, I am crying, for I have somethii^ to tell 
you, Arthur. 

LORD WINDERMERE 

My dear child, you are not well. You've been 
doing too much. Let us go away to the country. 
You'll be all right at Selby. The season is almost 
over. There is no use staying on. Poor darling I 
We'll go away to-day, if you like. [Rises.] We 
can easily catch the 4.3a 111 send a wire to

Yes ; let us go away to-day. No ; I can't go to- 
day, Arthur. There is some one I must see before 
I leave town — some one who has been kind to me. 

LORD WINDERMERE 

[Rising and leaning over sofa.] Kind to you ? 
LADY WINDERMERE 

Far more than that [Rises and goes to him.] 
I will tell you, Arthur, but only love me, love me

LADY WINDERMERE 

I don't I know now I was wrong and foolish. 

LORD WINDERMERE 

It was very good of you to recrive her last night 
— but you are never to see her again. 

LADY WINDERMERE 
Why do you say that ? [A pause.'] 

LORD WINDERMERE 

[Holding her hand.] Margaret, 1 thought Mrs. 
Erlynne was a woman more sinned against than 
sinning, as the phrase goes. I thought she wanted 
to be good, to get back into a place that she had 
lost by a moment's folly, to lead again a decent 
life. I believed what she told me — I was mistaken 
in her. She is bad — as bad as a woman can be. 

LADY WINDERMERE 

Arthur, Arthur, don't talk so bitterly about any 
woman. I don't think now that people can be 
divided into the good and the bad, as though they 
were two separate races or creations. What are 
called good women may have terrible things in 
them, mad moods of recklessness, assertion, 
jealousy, sin. Bad women, as they are termed, 
may have in them sorrow, repentance, pity, sacri- 
fice. And I don't think Mrs. Erlynne a bad 
woman — I know she's not.

My dear child, the woman's impossible. No 
matter what harm she tries to do us, you must 
never see her again. She is inadmissible any- 
where. 



LADY WINDERMERE 

But I want to see her. I want her to come 
here. 

LORD WINDERMERE 
Never ! 

LADY WINDERMERE 

She came here once as your guest She must 
come now as mine. That is but fair.

I have lived childless — I want to live childless still. 
[Hiding her feelings with a trivial laugh.] Besides,

her illusions ? I find it hard enough to keep my

had no heart I find I have, and a heart doesn't 
suit me, Windermere. Somehow it doesn't go
