FIRST ACT 






ACT I 

Scene — The octagon room at sir Robert chil- 
tern's house in Grosvenor Square. 

[The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests. 
At the top of the staircase stands lady chiltern^ a 
woman of grave Greek beauty, about twenty-seven 
years of age. She receives the guests as they come up. 
Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier 
with wax lights, which illumine a large eighteenth-- 
century French tapestry — representing the Triumph 
of Love, from a design by Boucher — that is stretched 
on the staircase wall. On the right is the entrance to 
the music-room. The sound of a string quartette is 
faintly heard. The entrance on the left leads to 
other reception-rooms, mrs. marchmont and lady 
BASILDON^ two Very pretty women, are seated together 
on a Louis Seize sofa. They are types of ejpquisite 
fragility. Their affectation of manner has a delicate 
charm. Watteau would have loved to paint themj] 

MRS. MARCHMONT. Going on to the Hartlocks' to- 
night^ Margaret? 

LADY BASILDON. I supposc SO. Are you? 

MRS. MARCHMONT. Yes. Horribly tedious parties 
they give, don't they? 

LADY BASILDON. Horribly tedious! Never know 
why I go. Never know why I go anywhere. 

MRS. MARCHMONT. I come here to be educated. 

LADY BASILDON. Ah ! I hate being educated ! 

MRS. MARCHMONT. So do I. It puts One almost on 
a level with the commercial classes, doesn't it? But 



2 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I 
should have some serious purpose in life. So I come 
here to try to find one. 

LADY BASILDON [Looking roufid through her lorg- 
nette]. I don't see anybody here to-night whom one 
could possibly call a serious purpose. The man who 
took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the 
whole time. 

MRS. MARCHMONT. How Very trivial of him ! 

LADY BASILDON. Terribly trivial! What did your 
man talk about? 

MRS. MARCHMONT. About mysclf. 

LADY BASILDON [Languidly], And were you inter- 
ested? 

MRS. MARCHMONT [Shaking her head]. Not in the 
smallest degree. 

LADY BASILDON. What martyrs we are^ dear Mar- 
garet ! 

MRS. MARCHMONT [Rising], And how well it be- 
comes us^ Olivia! 

[They rise and go towards the music-room. The 
vicoMTE DE NANJAC^ a young attache known for his 
neckties and his Anglomania, approaches with a low 
bow, and enters into conversation.] 

MASON [Announcing guests from the top of the 
staircase], Mr. and Lady Jane Barford. Lord 
Caversham. 

[Enter lord caversham^ an old gentleman of 
seventy, wearing the riband and star of the Garter, 
A fine Whig type. Rather like a portrait by Law- 
rence.] 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Good evening, Lady Chiltern! 
Has my good-for-nothing young son been here? 

LADY CHILTERN [Smiling], I don't think Lord 
Goring has arrived yet. 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 3 

MABEL CHILTERN [Coming Up tO LORD CAVERSHAm]. 

Why do you call Lord Goring good-for-nothing? 

[mabel CHILTERN is a perfect example of the Eng-^ 
lish type of prettiness, the apple-blossom type. She has 
all the fragrance and freedom of a flower. There is 
ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair, and the 
little mouth, with its parted lips, is expectant, like the 
mouth of a child. She has the fascinating tyranny 
of youth, and the astonishing courage of innocence. 
To sane people she is not reminiscent of any work of 
art. But she is really like a Tanagra statuette, and 
would be rather annoyed if she were told so.] 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Bccausc he leads such an idle 
life. 

MABEL CHILTERN. How Can you Say such a thing? 
Why, he rides in the Row at ten o'clock in the morn- 
ing, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his 
clothes at least ^ve times a day, and dines out every 
night of the season. You don't call that leading an 
idle life, do you? 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Looking at her with a kindly 
twinkle in his eyes] . You are a very charming young 
lady! 

MABEL CHILTERN. How swcct of you to Say that. 
Lord Caversham! Do come to us more often. You 
know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and 
you look so well with your star! 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Ncver go anywhere now. Sick 
of London Society. Shouldn't mind being introduced 
to my own tailor; he always votes on the right side. 
But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with 
my wife's milliner. Never could stand Lady Cavers- 
ham's bonnets. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Oh, I love London Society! I 
think it has immensely improved. It is entirely com- 



4 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

posed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics. 
Just what Society should be. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Hum ! Which is Goring? 
Beautiful idiot, or the other thing? 

MABEL CHiLTERN [Gravely^, I have been obliged 
for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite 
by himself. But he is developing charmingly ! 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Into what? 

MABEL CHILTERN [With a little curtsey^. I hope to 
let you know very soon. Lord Caversham ! 

MASON [Announcing guests'\. Lady Markby. Mrs. 
Cheveley. 

[Enter lady markby and mrs. cheveley. lady 
MARKBY is a pleasant, kindly, popular woman, with 
gray hair a la marquise and good, lace, mrs. 
cheveley, who accompanies her, is tall and rather 
slight. Lips very thin and highly-coloured, a line of 
scarlet on a pallid face. Venetian red hair, aquiline 
nose, and long throat. Rouge accentuates the natural 
paleness of her complexion. Gray-green eyes that 
move restlessly. She is in heliotrope, with diamonds. 
She looks rather like an orchid, and makes great de- 
mands on one's curiosity. In all her movements she is 
extremely graceful, A work of art, on the whole, but 
showing the influence of too many schools,] 

LADY MARKBY. Good evening, dear Gertrude! So 
kind of you to let me bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley. 
Two such charming women should know each other! 

LADY CHILTERN [Advanccs towards mrs. cheveley 
with a sweet smile. Then suddenly stops, and hows 
rather distantly], I think Mrs. Cheveley and I have 
met before. I did not know she had married a sec- 
ond time. 

LADY markby [Genially], Ah, nowadays people 
marry as often as they can, don't they? It is most 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 5 

fashionable. [To duchess of Maryborough.] Dear 
Duchess^ and how is the Duke.'* Brain still weak^ I 
suppose? Well, that is only to be expected, is it not? 
His good father was just the same. There is nothing 
like race, is there? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Playing with her fan]. But have 
we really met before. Lady Chiltern ? I can't remem- 
ber where. I have been out of England for so long. 

LADY CHILTERN. We wcrc at school together, Mrs. 
Cheveley. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [SuperciUousl^], Indeed? I have 
forgotten all about my schooldays. I have a vague 
impression that they were detestable. 

LADY CHILTERN [Coldy], I am not surprised! 

MRS. CHEVELEY [In her sweetest manner]. Do 
you know, I am quite looking forward to meeting your 
clever husband. Lady Chiltern. Since he has been at 
the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in 
Vienna. They actually succeed in spelling his name 
right in the newspapers. That in itself is fame, on 
the continent. 

LADY CHILTERN. I hardly think there will be much 
in common between you and my husband, Mrs. 
Cheveley! [Moves away,] 

vicoMTE DE NANJAC. Ah I cherc Madame, quelle 
surprise I I have not seen you since Berlin ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Not sincc Berlin, Vicomte. Five 
years ago! 

VICOMTE DE NANJAC. And you are younger and 
more beautiful than ever. How do you manage it? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. By making it a rule only to talk 
to perfectly charming people like yourself. 

VICOMTE DE NANJAC Ah I you flatter me. Ypu 
butter me^ as the^ sa^ her^, 



AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 



MRS. CHEVELEY. Do they say that here? How 
dreadful of them ! 

YicoMTE DE NANJAc. Ycs, they have a wonderful 
language. It should be more widely known. 

[sir ROBERT cHiLTERN enters, A man of forty, hut 
looking somewhat younger. Clean-shaven, with finely- 
cut features, dark-haired and dark-eyed. A person- 
ality of mark. Not popular — few personalities are. 
But intensely admired by the few, and deeply re- 
spected by the many. The note of his manner is that 
of perfect distinction, with a slight touch of pride. 
One feels that he is conscious of the success he has 
made in life. A nervous temperament, with a tired 
look. The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast 
strikingly with the romantic expression in the deep-set 
eyes. The variance is suggestive of an almost com- 
plete separation of passion and intellect, as though 
thought and emotion were each isolated in its own 
sphere through some violence of will-power. There is 
nervousness in the nostrils, and in the pale, thin, 
pointed hands. It would be inaccurate to call him 
picturesque. Picturesqueness cannot survive the House 
of Commons. But Vandyke would have liked to have 
painted his head.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Good evening, Lady Mark- 
by ! I hope you have brought Sir John with you ? 

LADY MARKBY. Oh! I have brought a much more 
charming person than Sir John. Sir John's temper 
since he has taken seriously to politics has become 
quite unbearable. Really, now that the House of 
Commons is trying to become useful, it does a great 
deal of harm. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I hopc uot. Lady Markby. 
^t any rate we do our best to waste the public time. 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 7 

don't we ? But who is this charming person you have 
been kind enough to bring to us? 

LADY MARKBY. Her name is Mrs. Cheveley! One 
of the Dorsetshire Cheveleys, I suppose. But I really 
don't know. Families are so mixed nowadays. In- 
deed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody 
else. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Mrs. Cheveley? I seem to 
know the name. 

LADY MARKBY. She has just arrived from Vienna. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ah! yes. I think I know 
whom you mean. 

LADY MARKBY. Oh ! shc goes everywhere there, and 
has such pleasant scandals about all her friends. I 
really must go to Vienna next winter. I hope there 
is a good chef at the Embassy. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. If thcrc is not, the Ambas- 
sador will certainly have to be recalled. Pray point 
out Mrs. Cheveley to me. I should like to see her. 

LADY MARKBY. Let mc introduce you. [To mrs. 
CHEVELEY.] My dear. Sir Robert Chiltern is dying 
to know you! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Bowiug] . Everybody is dy- 
ing to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley. Our at- 
taches at Vienna write to us about nothing else. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thank you. Sir Robert. An ac- 
quaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to 
develop into a real friendship. It starts in the right 
manner. And I find that I know Lady Chiltern al- 
ready. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Really? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Ycs. She has just reminded me 
that we were at school together. I remember it per- 
fectly now. She always got the good conduct prize. 



8 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltem always 
getting the good conduct prize! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Smiling], And what prizes 
did you get, Mrs. Cheveley? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. My prizcs came a little later on in 
life. I don't think any of them were for good con- 
duct. I forget! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I am suTC they were for 
something charming ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I don't know that women are al- 
ways rewarded for being charming. I think they are 
usually punished for it ! Certainly, more women grow 
old nowadays through the faithfulness of their ad- 
mirers than through anything else! At least that is 
the only way I can account for the terribly haggard 
look of most of your pretty women in London ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What an appalling phi- 
losophy that sounds I To attempt to classify you, Mrs. 
Cheveley, would be an impertinence. But may I ask, 
at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist? Those 
seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us 
nowadays. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh, I'm neither. Optimism be- 
gins in a broad grin, and Pessimism ends with blue 
spectacles. Besides, they are both of them merely 
poses. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. You prefer to be natural ? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Somctimcs. But it is such a very 
difficult pose to keep up. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What would thosc modcm 
psychological novelists, of whom we hear so much, say 
to such a theory as that? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Ah ! the strength of women comes 
from the fact that psychology cannot explain us. Men 
can be analyzed, women . . . merely adored, 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 9 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. You think science cannot 
grapple with the problem of women? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Scicncc can never grapple with 
the irrational. That is why it has no future before it, 
in this world. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. And womcn represent the 
irrational. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Wcll-drcssed women do. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [With a poUte bow]. I fear 
I could hardly agree with you there. But do sit down. 
And now tell me, what makes you leave your brilliant 
Vienna for our gloomy London — or perhaps the ques- 
tion is indiscreet? * 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Qucstious are never indiscreet. 
Answers sometimes are. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Well, at any rate, may I 
know if it is politics or pleasure? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Politics are my only pleasure. You 
see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is 
forty, or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we 
poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have . 
nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy. And 
philanthropy, seems to me to have become simply the 
refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow- 
creatures. I prefer politics. I think they are more 
. . . becoming! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. A political life is a noble 
career ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Sometimcs. And sometimes it is a 
clever game. Sir Robert. And sometimes it is a great 
nuisance. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Which do you find it? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I? A Combination pf all thre^. 
[Drops her fan,'\ 



10 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

8IR ROBERT CHILTERN [Picks Up fan]. Allow me! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. But you havc not told me 
yet what makes you honour London so suddenly. Our 
season is almost over. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh ! I don't care about the Lon- 
don season ! It is too matrimonial. People are either 
hunting for husbands^ or hiding from them. I wanted 
to meet you. It is quite true. You know what a 
woman's curiosity is. Almost as great as a man's! 
I wanted immensely to meet you^ and ... to ask you 
to do something for me. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I hopc it is uot a little 
things Mrs. Cheveley. I find that little things are 
SO very difficult to do. 

MRS CHEVELEY [After a moment's reflection]. No, 
I don't think it is quite a little thing. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I am SO glad. Do tell me 
what it is. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Later on. [2?we*.] And now 
may I walk through your beautiful house? I hear 
your pictures are charming. Poor Baron Arnheim — 
you remember the Baron? — used to tell me you had 
some wonderful Corots. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [With an olmost imperceptible 
$tart]. Did you know Baron Arnheim well? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Smiling] . Intimately. Did you ? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. At onc time. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Woudcrf ul man, wasn't he ? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [After a pause]. He was 
very remarkable, in many ways. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I often think it such a pity he 
never wrote his memoirs. They would have been most 
ipterestin^. 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 11 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Yes ; he knew men and cities 
well^ like the old Greek. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Without the dreadful disadvan- 
tage of having a Penelope waiting at home for him. 

MASON. Lord Goring. 

[Enter lord goring. Thirty-four, hut always says 
he is younger. A well-bred, expressionless face. He 
is clever, but would not like to be thought so. A flaw- 
less dandy, he would be annoyed if he were considered 
romantic. He plays with life, and is on perfectly 
good terms with the world. He is fond of being mis- 
understood. It gives him a post of vantage.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Good evening, my dear 
Arthur! Mrs. Cheveley, allow me to introduce to 
you Lord Goring^ the idlest man in London. 

MRS. CHEVELEY* I havc met Lord Goring before. 

LORD ooRiNO [Bowing] . I did not think you would 
remember me, Mrs. Cheveley. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. My mcmory is under admirable 
control. And are vou still a bachelor ? 

LORD GORING. I . . . beliCVC SO. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. How vcry romantic ! 

LORD LORiNG. Oh! I am not at all romantic. I 
am not old enough. I leave romance to my seniors. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Lord GoHug is the result of 
Boodle's Club, Mrs. Cheveley. , 

MRS. CHEVELEY. He rcflccts cvcry credit on the in- 
stitution. 

LORD GORING. May I ask are you staying in Lon- 
don long? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. That depends partly on the 
weather, partly on the cooking, and partly on Sir 
Robert. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. You are uot going to plunge 
^jS intp a European war^ I hope?

[She nodi to lord goring^ ftitk a look of afnuse- 
ment in her eyes, and goes out with sir Robert chil-

TERN.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. You are Very late ! 
LORD GORING. Have yon missed me? 

MABEL CHILTERN. Awf nlly ! 

LORD GORING. Then I am sorry I did not stay 
away longer. I like being missed. 

MABEL CHILTERN. How verv selfish of you! 

LORD GORING. I am Very selfish. 

MABEL CHILTERN. You are always telling me of 
your bad qualities, Lord Goring. 

LORD GORING. I have only told you half of them as 
yet, Miss Mabel! 

MABEL CHILTERN. Are the others very bad? 

LORD GORING. Quitc drcadfuI! When I think of 
them at night I go to sleep at once. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Well, I delight in your bad 
qualities. I wouldn't have you part with one of them. 

LORD GORING. How Very nice of you! But then 
you are always nice. By the way, I want to ask you 
a question. Miss Mabel. Who brought Mrs. Cheveley 
here? That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone 
out of the room with your brother ? 

MABEL CHILTERN. Oh, I think Lady Markby 
brought her. Why do you ask? 

LORD GORING. I hadn't seen her for years, that is 
aU. 

MABEL CHILTERN. What an absurd reason! 

LORD GORING. All reasous are absurd. 

MABEL CHILTERN. What sort of woman is she ? 

LORD GORING. Oh! a genius in the daytime and a 
beauty at night !

MABEL CHILTERN. I dislike her already. 

LORD GORING. That shows your admirable good 
taste. 

YicoMTE DE NAN JAC [Appvoacking] . Ah, the Eng-

Quite the dragon of good taste. 

LORD GORING. So the uewspapers are always telling 
us. 

YICOMTE DE NANJAC. I read all your English 
newspapers. I find them so amusing. 

LORD GORING. Then, my dear Nanjac, you must 
certainly read between the lines. 

vicoMTE DE NANJAC. I should like to, but my pro- 
fessor objects. [To MABEL CHILTERN.] May I have 
the pleasure of escorting you to the music-room. 
Mademoiselle ? 

MABEL CHILTERN [Looking Very disappointed] . De- 
lighted, Vicomte, quite delighted! [Turning to lord 
GORING.] Aren't you coming to the music-room? 

LORD GORING. Not if there is any music going on. 
Miss Mabel. 

MABEL CHILTERN [Severely]. The music is in Ger- 
man. You would not understand it. 

[Goes out with the vicomte de nanjac. lord 
CAVERSHAM comes up to his son,] 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir ! what are you doing 
here? Wasting your life as usual! You should be 
in bed, sir. You keep too late hours ! I heard of you 
the other night at Lady RufTord's dancing till four 
o'clock in the morning! 

LORD GORING. Only a quarter to four, father. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Can't make out how you stand

Nothing ages like happiness. 

LOBD CATZBSHAM. You are heartless, sir, Yery 
heartless! 

LORD GORING. I hope not, father. Good erenini^ 
Lady Basildon! 

LADT BASILDON [Arcking two pretty eyebrows]. Are 
yoa here? I had no idea yon ever came to political 
parties! 

LORD GORING. I adorc political parties. They are 
the only place left to us where people don't talk 
politics. 

LADT BASILDON. I delight in talking politics. I 
talk them all day long. But I can't bear listening to 
them. I don't know how the unfortunate men in the 
House stand these long debates. 

LORD GORING. By ncver listening. 

LADY BASILDON. Reallv? 

LORD GORING [In hu most serious manner]. Of 
course. You see, it is a very dangerous thing to listen. 
If one listens one may be convinced; and a man who 
allows himself to be convinced by an argument is a 
thoroughly unreasonable person. 

LADY BASILDON. Ah I that accouuts for so much in 
men that I have never understood, and so much in 
women that their husbands never appreciate in them! 

MRS. MARCHMONT [With a sigh]. Our husbands 
never appreciate anything in us. We have to go to 
others for that! 

LADY BASILDON [Emphatically]. Yes, always to 
others, have we not? 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 15 

LORD GORING [Smiling], And those are the views 
of the two ladies who are known to have the most 
admirable husbands in London. 

MRS. MARCHMONT. That is exactly what we can't 
stand. My Reginald is quite hopelessly faultless. He 
is really unendurably so, at times ! There is not the 
smallest element of excitement in knowing him. 

LORD GORING. How terrible! Really, the thing 
should be more widely known ! 

LADY BASILDON. Basildou is quite as bad; he is as 
domestic as if he was a bachelor. 

MRS. MARCHMONT [Pressing lady basildon's hand] . 
My poor Olivia ! We have married perfect husbands, 
and we are well punished for it. 

lord oorino. I should have thought it was the 
husbands who were punished. 

MRS. MARCHMONT [Drawing herself up]. Oh, dear 
no! They are as happy as possible! And as for 
trusting us, it is tragic how much they trust us. 

LADY BASILDON. Perfectly tragic ! 

LORD GORING. Or comic. Lady Basildon } 

LADY BASILDON. Certainly not comic. Lord Goring. 
How unkind of you to suggest such a thing ! 

MRS. MARCHMONT. I am afraid Lord Goring is in 
the camp of the enemy, as usual. I saw him talking 
to that Mrs. Cheveley when he came in. 

LORD GORING. Handsomc woman, Mrs. Cheveley! 

LADY BASILDON [Stiffly]. Plcasc don't praise other 
women in our presence. You might wait for us to do 
that! 

LORD GORING. I did Wait. 

MRS. MARCHMONT. Well, wc are not going to praise 
her. I hear she went to the Opera on Monday night, 
and told Tommy RufFord at supper that, as far as she 



16 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

could see^ London Society was entirely made up of 
dowdies and dandies. 

LORD GORING. She is quite rights too. The men 
are all dowdies and the women are all dandies^ aren't 
they.^ 

MRS. MARCHMONT [After a pause]. Oh! do yon 
really think that is what Mrs. Cheveley meant? 

LORD GORING. Of coursc. And a very sensible re- 
mark for Mrs. Cheveley to make^ too. 

[Enter mabel chiltern. She joins the group.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. Why are you talking about Mrs. 
Cheveley ? Everybody is talking about Mrs. Cheveley ! 
Lord Goring says — what did you say^ Lord Goring, 
about Mrs. Cheveley f Oh ! I remember^ that she was 
a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night. 

LADY BASILDON. What a horrid combination! So 
very unnatural ! 

MRS. MARCHMONT [In her most dreamt^ manner]. I 
like looking at geniuses, and listening to beautiful peo- 
ple. 

LORD GORING. Ah! that is morbid of you, Mrs. 
Marchmont ! 

MRS. MARCHMONT [Brightening to a look of real 
pleasure], I am so glad to hear you say that. March- 
mont and I have been married for seven years, and he 
has never once told me that I was morbid. Men are 
so painfully unobservant! 

LADY BASILDON [Tuming to her], I have always 
said, dear Margaret, that you were the most morbid 
person in London. 

MRS. MARCHMONT. Ah! but you are always sym- 
pathetic, Olivia! 

MABEL CHILTERN. Is it morbid to have a desire for 
food ^ I have a great desire for food. Lord Goring, 
will you give me some supper? 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 17 

LORD GORING. With pleasuTc, Miss Mabel. [Moves 
away with her,] 

MABEL cHiLTERN. How horrid you have been ! You 
have never talked to me the whole evening ! 

LORD GORING. How could I ? You weut away with 
the child-diplomatist. 

MABEL CHILTERN. You might havc followed us. 
Pursuit would have been only polite. I don't think I 
like you at all this evening! 

LORD GORING. I like you immensely. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Well, I wish you'd show it in a 
more marked way! [^hey go downstairs,] 

MRS. MARCHMONT. Olivia, I have a curious feeling 
of absolute faintness. I think I should like some 
supper very much. I know I should like some supper. 

LADY BASILDON. I am positively dying for supper, 
Margaret ! 

MRS. MARCHMONT. Men are so horribly selfish, they 
never think of these things. 

LADY BASILDON. Men are grossly material, grossly 
material ! 

[The vicoMTE DE NAN J AC enters from the music- 
room with some other guests. After having care- 
fully examined all the 'people present, he approaches 

LADY BASILDON.] 

VICOMTE DE NAN JAC. May I havc the honor of tak- 
ing you down to supper, Comtesse ? 

LADY BASILDON [Coldly], I never take supper, 
thank you, Vicomte. [ The vicomte is about to retire, 
LADY BASILDON, Seeing this, rises at once and takes 
his arm,] But I will come down with you with pleas- 
ure.

be brilliant at breakfast. That is so dreadful of 
them! Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast. 
And then the family skeleton is always reading family 

l' prayers. My stay in England really depends on you. 

Sir Robert. [Sits down on the sofa,] 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN [Taking a seat beside her]. 
Seriously ? 

i MRS. CHEVELEY. Quitc seriously. I want to talk 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 19 

to you about a great political and financial scheme^ 
about this Argentine Canal Company, in fact. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. A^liat SL tcdious, practical 
subject for you to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley ! 

MRS. CHEYELET. Oh^ I like tedious^ practical sub- 
jects. What I don't like are tedious, practical people. 
There is a wide difference. Besides, you are inter- 
ested^ I know^ in International Canal schemes. You 
were Lord Radley's secretary, weren't you, when the 
Government bought the Suez Canal shares? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ycs. But the Sucz Canal 
was a very great and splendid undertaking. It gave 
us our direct route to India. It had imperial value. 
It was necessary that we should have control. This 
Argentine scheme is a commonplace Stock Exchange 
swindle. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. A Speculation^ Sir Robert! A 
brilliant^ daring speculation. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Bclicve me, Mrs. Cheveley, 
it is a swindle. Let us call things by their proper 
names. It makes matters simpler. We have all the 
information about it at the Foreign Office. In fact, I 
sent out a special Commission to inquire into the mat- 
ter privately, and they report that the works are hard- 
ly begun, and as for the money already subscribed, no 
one seems to know what has become of it. The whole 
thing is a second Panama, and with not a quarter of 
the chance of success that miserable affair ever had. 
I hope you have not invested in it. I am sure you are 
far too clever to have done that. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I havc invested very largely in it. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Who could havc adviscd you 
to do such a foolish thing? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Your old friend — and mine. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Who? 



20 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

MRS. CHEYELEY. Baron Amheim. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Frowniug]. Ah! yes. I 
remember hearings at the time of his deaths that he 
had been mixed up in the whole affair. 

MRS. CHEYELEY. It was his last romance. His last 
but one^ to do him justice. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Rising]. But you haYe not 
seen my Corots yet. They are in the music-room« 
Corots seem to go with music^ don't they.^ May I 
show them to you? 

MRS. CHEYELEY [Shaking her head] . I am not in 
a mood to-night for silver twilights, or rose-pink 
dawns. I want to talk business. [Motions to him 
with her fan to sit down again beside her.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I fcar I havc uo advicc to 
give you, Mrs. Cheveley, except to interest yourself 
in something less dangerous. The success of the 
Canal depends, of course, on the attitude of England, 
and I am going to lay the report of the Commission- 
ers before the House to-morrow night. 

MRS. CHEYELEY. That you must not do. In your 
own interests. Sir Robert, to say nothing of mine, you 
must not do that. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Looking at her in wonder]. 
In my own interests? My dear Mrs. Cheveley, what 
do you mean? [Sits down beside her.] 

MRS. CHEYELEY. Sir Robert, I will be quite frank 
with you. I want you to withdraw the report that 
you had intended to* lay before the House, on the 
ground that you have reasons to believe that the Com- 
missioners have been prejudiced or misinformed, or 
something. Then I want you to say a few words to 
the effect that the Government is going to reconsider 
the question, and that you have reason to believe that 
the Canal, if completed, will be of great international 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 21 

value. You know the sort of things ministers say 
in cases of this kind. A few ordinary platitudes will 
do. In modem life nothing produces such an effect as 
a good platitude. It makes the whole world kin. 
Will you do this for me ? 

SIR ROBERT cHiLTERN. Mrs. Chcveley, you cannot 
be serious in making me such a proposition ! 

MRS. CHEYELEY. I am quitc serious. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Coldtf]. Pray allow me to 
believe that you are not ! 

MRS. CHEYELET [Speaking with great deliberation 
and emphasis] . Ah ! but I am. And^ if you do what 
I ask you, I . . . will pay you very handsomely! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Pay me ! 

MRS. CHEYELEY. YcS. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I am afraid I don't quitQ 
understand what you mean. 

MRS. CHEYELEY. [Leaning hack on the sofa and 
looking at him]. How very disappointing! And I 
have come all the way from Vienna in order that you 
should thoroughly understand me. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I fear I dou't. 

MRS. CHEYELEY [In her most nonchalant manner]. 
My dear Sir Robert, you are a man of the world, and 
you have your price, I suppose. Everybody has now- 
adays. The drawback is that most people are so 
dreadfully expensive. I know I am. I hope you will 
be more reasonable in your terms. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Rises indignantlff] , If yon 
will allow me, I will call your carriage for you. You 
have lived so long abroad, Mrs. Cheveley, that you 
seem to be unable to realize that you are talking to an 
English gentleman. 

MRS. CHEYELEY [Detains him hy touching his arm 
with her fan, and keeping it there while she is talk" 



22 AN IDEAL HUSBai^^D [Act I 

ing]. I realize that I am talking to a man who laid 
the foundation of his fortune by selling to a Stock 
Exchange speculator a Cabinet secret. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN [Biting his Up]. What do 
you mean? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Rising and facing him], I mean 
that I know the real origin of your wealth and your 
career, and I have got your letter, too. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What letter? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [C ontemptuously] , The letter you 
wrote to Baron Arnheim, when you were Lord Rad- 
ley's secretary, telling the Baron to buy Suez Canal 
shares — a letter written three days before the Govern- 
ment announced its own purchase. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Hoarsely], It is not true. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. You thought that letter had been 
destroyed. How foolish of you! It is in my posses- 
sion. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. The affair to which you al- 
lude was no more than a speculation. The House of 
Commons had not yet passed the bill; it might have 
been rejected. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. It was a swiudlc. Sir Robert. Let 
us call things by their proper names. It makes every- 
thing simpler. And now I am going to sell you that 
letter, and the price I ask for it is your public support 
of the Argentine scheme. You made your own for- 
tune out of one canal. You must help me and my 
friends to make our fortunes out of another! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. It Is iufamous, what you 
propose — infamous ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh, no ! This is the game of life 
as we all have to play it. Sir Robert, sooner or later ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I cannot do what you ask 
me. 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 23 

MRS. CHEVELEY. You mean you cannot help doing 
it You know you are standing on the edge of a 
precipice. And it is not for you to make terms. It 
is for you to accept them. Supposing you refuse 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. What then ? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. My dear Sir Robert, what then? 
you are ruined, that is all ! Remember to what a point 
your Puritanism in England has brought you. In 
old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his 
neighbours. In fact, to be a bit better than one's 
neighbour was considered excessively vulgar and mid- 
dle-class. Nowadavs, with our modern mania for mo- 
rality^ everyone has to pose as a paragon of purity, 
incorruptibility, and all the other seven deadly vir- 
tues — and what is the result? You all go over like 
ninepins— one after the other. Not a year passes in 
England without somebody disappearing. Scandals 
used to lend charm, or at least interest, to a man — 
now they crush him. And yours is a very nasty scan- 
daL You couldn't survive it. If it were known that 
as a young 'onan, secretary to a great and important 
minister, you sold a Cabinet secret for a large sum 
of money, and that that was the origin of your wealth 
and career, you would be hounded out of public life, 
you would disappear completely. And after all. Sir 
Robert, why should you sacrifice your entire future 
rather than deal diplomatically with your enemy ? For 
the moment I am your enemy. I admit it ! And I am 
much stronger than you are. The big battalions are 
on my side. You have a splendid position, but it is 
your splendid position that makes you so vulnerable. 
You can't defend it ! And I am in attack. Of course 
I have not talked morality to you. You must admit 
in fairness that I have spared you that. Years ago 
you did a clever, unscrupulous thing; it turned out a 



24 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

great success. You owe to it your fortune and posi- 
tion. And now you have got to pay for it. Sooner 
or later we all have to pay for what we do. You 
have to pay now. Before I leave you to-night^ you 
have got to promise me to suppress your report^ and to 
speak in the House in favour of this scheme. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What you ask is impossible. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. You must make it possible. You 
are going to make it possible. Sir Robert^ yon know 
what your English newspapers are like. Suppose that 
when I leave this house I drive down to some news- 
paper office^ and give them this scandal and the proofs 
of it! Think of their loathsome joy, of the delight 
they would have in dragging you down, of the mud 
and mire they would plunge you in. Think of the 
hypocrite with his greasy smile penning his leading 
article, and arranging the foulness of the public pla- 
card. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Stop ! You Want me to 
withdraw the report and to make a short speech stat- 
ing that I believe there are possibilities in the scheme ? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Sitting dowu on the sofa] . Those 
are my terms. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [In a low voice], I Mrill g^ve 
you any sum of money you want. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Evcu you are not rich enough. Sir 
Robert, to buy back your past. No man is. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I will uot do what you ask. 
I will not 

MRS. CHEVELEY. You havc to. If you don't . . . 
[Rises from the sofa,] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [BetvUdered and unnerved]. 
Wait a moment! What did you propose? You said 
that you would give me back my letter, didn't you ? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. That is agreed. I will be 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 25 

in the Ladies' Gallery to-morrow night at half-past 
eleven. If by that time — and you will have had heaps 
of opportunity — ^you have made an announcement to 
the House in the terms I wish^ I shall hand you back 
your letter with the prettiest thanks^ and the best^ or 
at any rate the most suitable^ compliment I can think 
of. I intend to play quite fairly with you. One 
should always play fairly . . . when one has the win- 
ning cards. The Baron taught me that . . . amongst 
other things. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. You must let me have time 
to consider your proposal. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. No; you must settle now ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Givc mc a wcck — ^three 
days ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Impossiblc ! I havc got to tele- 
graph to Vienna to-night. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. My God ! what brought you 
into my life? 

MRS CHEVELEY. Circumstanccs. 

[Moves towards the door.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Dou't gO. I COUSCUt. The 

report shall be withdrawn. I will arrange for a ques- 
tion to be put to me on the subject. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thank you. I knew we should 
come to an amicable agreement. I understood your 
nature from the first. I analyzed you^ though you 
did not adore me. And now you can get my car- 
riage for me^ Sir Robert. I see the people coming up 
from supper^ and Englishmen always get romantic 
after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.

you have enjoyed yourself. Sir Robert is very enter- 
taining, is he not? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Most entertaining! I have en- 
joyed my talk with him immensely. 

LADY MARKBY. He has had a very interesting and 
brilliant career. And he has married a most admir- 
able wife. Lady Chiltem is a woman of the very 
highest principles, I am glad to say. I am a little too 
old now, myself, to trouble about setting a good ex- 
ample, but I always admire people who do. And 
Lady Chiltem has a very ennobling effect on life, 
though her dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes. 
But one can't have everything, can one.^ And now I 
must go, dear. Shall I call for you to-morrow.^ 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thauks. 

LADY MARKBY. We might drive in the Park at five. 
Everything looks so fresh in the Park now ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Except the people! 

LADY MARKBY. Pcrhaps the people are a little 
jaded. I have often observed that the Season as it 
goes on produces a kind of softening of the brain. 
However, I think anything is better than high intellec- 
tual pressure. That is the most unbecoming thing 
there is. It makes the noses of the young girls so 
particularly large. And there is nothing so difficult 
to marry as a large nose, men don't like them. Good- 
night, dear! [To lady chiltern.] Good-night, 
Gertrude! [Goes out on lord caversham^s arm.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. What a charming house you have. 
Lady Chiltern! I have spent a delightful evening. 
It has been so interesting getting to know your hus- 
band. 

LADY CHILTERN. Why did you wish to meet my 
husband, Mrs. Cheveley? 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 27 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh^ I will tell you. I wanted to 
interest him in this Argentine Canal scheme^ of which 
I dare say you have heard. And I found him most 
susceptible^ — susceptible to reason^ I mean. A rare 
thing in a man. I converted him in ten minutes. Me 
is going to make a speech in the House to-morrow 
night in favour of the idea. We must go to the 
Ladies' Gallery and hear him! It will be a great 
occasion ! 

LADY CHILTERN. There must be some mistake. That 
scheme could never have my husband's support. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh^ I assure you it's all settled. 
I don't regret my tedious journey from Vienna now. 
It has been a great success. But^ of course^ for the 
next twenty-four hours the whole thing is a dead 
secret. 

LADY CHILTERN \Genily\, A secret.^ Between 
whom? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [With a flash of amusement in her 
eyes]. Between your husband and myself. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Entering], Your carriage 
is here, Mrs. Cheveley ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thauks ! Good evening. Lady 
Chiltem! Good-night, Lord Goring! I am at 
Claridge's. Don't you think you might leave a card? 

toRD GORING. If you wish it, Mrs. Cheveley ! 

MRS. 6j0[EVELEY. Oh, don't be so solemn about it, or 
I shall be obliged to leave a card on you. In Eng- 
land I suppose that would be hardly considered 
en rigle. Abroad, we are more civilized. Will you 
see me down. Sir Robert? Now that we have both 
the same interests at heart we shall be great friends, 
I hope.

dorvn at them as they descend. Her expression is 
troubled. After a little time she is joined by some 
of the guests, and passes with them into another re- 
ception-room.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. What a horrid woman! 

LORD GORING. You should go to bcd^ Miss MabeL 

MABEL CHILTERN. Lord Goring! 

LORD GORING. Mj father told me to go to bed an 
hour ago. I don't see why I shouldn't give you the 
same advice. I always pass on good advice. It is 
the only thing to do with it. It is never of any use to 
oneself. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Lord Goring^ you are always 
ordering me out of the room. I think it most 
courageous of you. Especially as I am not going to 
bed for hours. [Goes over to sofa.] You can come 
and sit down if you like^ and talk about anything in 
the world, except the Royal Academy, Mrs. Cheveley, 
or novels in Scotch dialect. They are not improving 
subjects. [Catches sight of something that is lying 
on the sofa half-hidden by the cushion.] What is 
this.^ Some one has dropped a diamond brooch! 
Quite beautiful, isn't it? [Shows it to him.] I wish 
it was mine, but Gertrude won't let me wear anything 
but pearls, and I am thoroughly sick of pearls. They 
make one look so plain, so good and so intellectual 
I wonder whom the brooch belongs to. 

LORD GORING. I woudcr who dropped it. 

MABEL CHILTERN. It is a bcautiful brooch. 

LORD GORING. It is a handsomc bracelet. 

MABEL CHILTERN. It isn't a bracelet. It's a 
brooch. 

LORD GORING. It Can be used as a bracelet. [Takes 
it from her, and, pulling out a green letter-case, puts 
the ornament carefully in it, and replaces the whole

thing in his breast-pocket with the most perfect sang' 
froid.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. What are you doing? 

LORD GORING. Miss Mabel^ I am going to make a 
rather strange request of you. 

MABEL CHILTERN [Eagerly.] Oh^ pray do! I 
have been waiting for it all the evening. 

LORD GORING [Is a little taken aback, but recovers 
himself]. Don't mention to anybody that I have 
taken charge of this brooch. Should anyone write 
and claim it^ let me know at once. 

MABEL CHILTERN. That is & Strange request. 

LORD GORING. Wcll^ you scc I gavc this brooch to 
somebody once^ years ago. 

MABEL CHILTERN. YoU did? 
LORD GORING. YcS. 

[lady CHILTERN enters alone. The other guests 
have gone.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. Then I shall certainly bid you 
good-night. Good-night, Gertrude! [Exit.] 

LADY CHILTERN. Good-uight, dear! [To lord 
GORING.] You saw whom Lady Markby brought 
here to-night. 

LORD GORING. Ycs. It was an unpleasant sur- 
prise. What did she come here for? 

LADY CHILTERN. Apparently to try and lure Rob- 
ert to uphold some fraudulent scheme in which she 
is interested. The Argentine Canal, in fact. 

LORD GORING. She has mistaken her man, hasn't 
Bhe? 

LADY CHILTERN. She IS incapable of understand- 
ing an upright nature like my husband's ! 

LORD GORING. Ycs. I should fancy she came to

promised to look in at the Haitlocks. I belieye they 
have got a mauye Hungarian band that plays maave 
Hungarian mnsic See you soon. Good-bye. [£j;tt.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. How bcaotiful you look 
to-night, Gertrude! 

LADY CHILTERN. Robert, it is not true, is it? You 
are not going to lend your support to this Argentine 
speculation? You couldn't! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Starting]. Who told you I 
intended to do so? 

LADY CHILTERN. That woman who has just gone 
out, Mrs. Cheveley, as she calls herself now. She 
seemed to taunt me with it. Robert, I know this 
woman. You don't. We were at school together. 
She was untruthful, dishonest, an evil influence on 
everyone whose trust or friendship she could win. I 
hated, I despised her. She stole things, she was a 
thief. She was sent away for being a thief. Why 
do you let her influence you ? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Gcrtrudc, what you tell me 
may be true, but it happened many years ago. It is 
best forgotten! Mrs. Cheveley may have changed 
since then. No one should be entirely judged by 
their past 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 81 

LADY CHiLTERN [Sndli/]. One's past is what one 
is. It is the only way by which people should be 
judged. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. That Is a hard sayings 
Gertrude ! 

LADY CHILTERN. It is a true sayings Robert. And 
what did she mean by boasting that she had got you 
to lend your support, your name to a thing I have 
heard you describe as the most dishonest and fraudu- 
lent scheme there has ever been in political life? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Biting his Up]. I was 
mistaken in the view I took. We all may make mis- 
takes. 

LADY CHILTERN. But you told me yesterday that 
you had received the report from the Commission, 
and that it entirely condemned the whole thing. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Walking up and down], I 
have reasons now to believe that the Commission was 
prejudiced, or, at any rate, misinformed. Besides, 
Gertrude, public and private life are different things. 
They have different laws, and move on different 
lines. 

LADY CHILTERN. They should both represent man 
at his highest. I see no difference between them. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Stopping]. In the present 
case, on a matter of practical politics, I have changed 
my mind. That is all. 

LADY CHILTERN. All! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Sternly], Yes! 

LADY CHILTERN. Robert! Oh! it is horrible that I 
should have to ask you such a question — Robert, are 
you telling me the whole truth ? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Why do you ask me such a 
question ? 



32 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

LADY CHILTERN [After a pause]. Why do you not 
answer it? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Sitting dowfi], Gertrude^ 
truth is a very complex things and politics is a very 
complex business. There are wheels within wheels. 
One may be under certain obligations to people that 
one must pay. Sooner or later in political life one 
has to compromise. Everyone does. 

LADY CHILTERN. Compromise? Robert, why do 
you talk so differently to-night from the way I have 
always heard you talk ? Why are you changed ? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I am uot changed. But cir- 
cumstances alter things. 

LADY CHILTERN. Circumstauccs should never alter 
principles ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. But if I told yOU 

LADY CHILTERN. What? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. That it was ncccssary, 
vitally necessary. 

LADY CHILTERN. It cau ucvcr bc ucccssary to do 
what is not honourable. Or if it be necessary, then 
what is it that I have loved! But it is not, Robert; 
tell me it is not. Why should it be? What gain 
would you get ? Money ? We have no need of that ! 
And money that comes from a tainted source is a 
degradation. Power? But power is nothing in 
itself. It is power to do good that is fine — ^that, 
and that only. What is it, then? Robert, tell me 
why you are going to do this dishonourable thing ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Gertrude, you have no 
right to use that word. I told you it was a question 
of rational compromise. It is no more than that. 

LADY CHILTERN. Robcrt, that is all very well for 
other men, for men who treat life simply as a sordid 
speculation; but not for you, Robert, not for you. 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 33 

You are different. All your life you have stood 
apart from others. You have never let the world 
soil you. To the world, as to myself, you have been 
an ideal always. Oh ! be that ideal still. That great 
inheritance throw not away — ^that tower of ivory do 
not destroy. Robert, men can love what is beneath 
them — things unworthy, stained, dishonoured. We 
women worship when we love; and when we lose our 
worship, we lose everything. Oh! don't kill my love 
for you, don't kill that ! 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. Gertrude! 

LADT CHiLTERN. I kuow that there are men with 
horrible secrets in their lives — ^men who have done 
some shameful thing, and who in some critical moment 
have to pay for it, by doing some other act of shame 
— oh ! don't tell me you are such as they are ! Robert, 
is there in your life any secret dishonour or disgrace? 
Tell me, tell me at once, that 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. That what? 

LADY CHILTERN [Speaking very glotvly]. That 
our lives may drift apart. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Drift apart? 

LADT CHILTERN. That they may be entirely sepa- 
rate. It would be better for us both. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Gcrtrudc, there is nothing 
in my past life that you might not know. 

LADT CHILTERN. I was surc of it, Robert, I was 
sure of it. But why did you say those dreadful 
things, things so unlike your real self? Don't let us 
ever talk about the subject again. You will write, 
won't you, to Mrs. Cheveley, and tell her that you 
cannot support this scandalous scheme of hers? If 
you have given her any promise you must take it back, 
that is all I 



84 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act I 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. Mnst I Write and tell her 
that? 

LADY CHILTERN. Surely^ Robeit! What else is 
there to do? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I might sce her personally. 
It would be better. 

LADY CHILTERN. You must never see her again^ 
Robert. She is not a woman you should ever speak to. 
She is not worthy to talk to a man like you. No; you 
must write to her at once^ now^ this moment^ and let 
your letter show her that your decision is quite irrev- 
ocable ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Write this moment! 

LADY CHILTERN. YcS. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. But it is SO late. It is 
close on twelve. 

LADY CHILTERN. That makcs no matter. She 
must know at once that she has been mistaken in you 
— and that you are not a man to do anything base or 
underhand or dishonourable. Write here, Robert, 
write that you decline to support this scheme of hers, 
as you hold it to be a dishonest scheme. Yes — write 
the word dishonest. She knows what that word means. 
[sir ROBERT CHILTERN sits dowfi and writes a letter. 
His wife takes it up and reads it."] Yes; that will do. 
[Rings hell.] And now the envelope. [He writes 
the envelope slowly. Enter mason.] Have this let- 
ter sent at once to Claridge's Hotel. There is no 
answer. [Exit mason, lady chiltern kneels down 
beside her husband and puts her arms round him.] 
Robert, love gives one a sort of instinct to things. 
I feel to-night that I have saved you from something 
that might have been a danger to you, from some- 
thing that might have made men honour you less than 
they do. I don't think you realize sufficiently. 



Act I] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 35 

Robert, that you have brought into the political life 
of our time a nobler atmosphere, a finer attitude 
towards life, a freer air of purer aims and higher 
ideals — I know it, and for that I love you, Robert. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. Oh, lovc mc always, Ger- 
trude, love me always ! 

LADY CHILTERN. I wiU lovc you always, because 
you will always be worthy of love. We needs must 
love the highest when we see it! [Kisses him and 
rises and goes out.] 

[sir ROBERT CHILTERN wolks up and down for a 
moment; then sits down and buries his face in his 
hands. The Servant enters and begins putting out 
the lights. SIR robert chiltern looks up.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Put out the lights, Mason, 
put out the lights! 

[The Servant puts out the lights. The room he- 
comes almost dark. • The only light there is comes 
from the great chandelier that hangs over the stair- 
case and illumines the tapestry of the Triumph of 
Love.\

SECOND ACT 



8T 



ACTH 

Scene — Morning-room at sir Robert chiltern's 
house. 

' [lord goring^ dressed in the height of fashion, is 
lounging in an armchair, sir Robert chiltern is 
standing in front of the fireplace. He is evidently 
in a state of great mental excitement and distress. 
As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and 
down the room.] 

lord goring. My dear Robert, it's a very awk- 
ward business, very awkward indeed. You should 
have told your wife the whole thing. Secrets from 
other people's wives are a necessary luxury in modem 
life. So, at least, I am always told at the club by 
people who are bald enough to know better. But no 
man should have a secret from his own wife. She 
invariably finds it out. Women have a wonderful 
instinct about things. They can discover everything 
except the obvious. 

sir ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur, I couldn't tell my 
wife. When could I have told her? Not last night. 
It would have made a life-long separation between 
us^ and I would have lost the love of the one woman 
in the world I worship, of the only woman who has 
ever stirred love within me. Last night it would have 
been quite impossible. She would have turned from 
me in horror ... in horror and in contempt. 

LORD GORING. Is Lady Chiltern as perfect as all 
that? 

89 



40 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ycs ; my wifc is as perfect 
as all that. 

LORD GORING [Taking off his left-hand glove]. 
What a pity! I beg your pardon, my dear fellow, I 
didn't quite mean that. But if what you tell me is 
true, I should like to have a serious talk about life 
with Lady Chiltern. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. It WOuld bc quitC USclcSS. 

LORD GORING. May I try? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ycs ; but nothing could 
make her alter her views. 

LORD GORING. Well, at the worst it would simply 
be a psychological experiment. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. All such experiments are 
terribly dangerous. 

LORD GORING. Everything is dangerous, my dear 
fellow. If it wasn't so, life wouldn't be worth liv- 
ing. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think 
you should have told her years ago. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. When ji When we were 
engaged.^ Do you think she would have married me 
if she had known that the origin of my fortune is 
such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and 
that I had done a thing that I suppose most men 
would call shameful and dishonourable? 

LORD GORING [Slowly], Ycs ; most men would call 
it ugly names. There is no doubt of that 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Bitterly], Men who every 
day do something of the same kind themselves. Men 
who, each one of them, have worse secrets in their 
own lives. 

LORD GORING. That is the reason they are so 
pleased to find out other people's secrets. It distracts 
public attention from their own. 



Act III AN IDEAL HUSBAND 41 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. And^ after all^ whom did I 
wrong by what I did? No one. 

LORD GORING [Loolctng at him steadily^. Except 
yourself, Robert. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [After a pause]. Of course 
I had private information about a certain transaction 
contemplated by the Government of the day, and I 
acted on it. Private information is practically the 
source of every large modern fortune. 

LORD GORING [Tapping his boot with his cane]. 
And public scandal invariably the result. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Pacing up and down the 
room]. Arthur, do you think that what I did nearly 
eighteen years ago should be brought up against me 
now? Do you think it fair that a man's whole career 
should be ruined for a fault done in one's boyhood 
almost. I was twenty-two at the time, and I had the 
double misfortune of being well-born and poor, two 
unforgivable things nowadays. Is it fair that the 
folly, the sin of one's youth, if men choose to call it 
a sin, should wreck a life like mine, should place me 
in the pillory, should shatter all that I have worked 
for, all that I have built up ? Is it fair, Arthur ? 

LORD GORING. Life is never fair, Robert. And 
perhaps it is a good thing for most of us that it is 
not. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Every man of ambition has 
to fight his century with its own weapons. What this 
century worships is wealth. The God of this century 
is wealth. To succeed one must have wealth. At all 
costs one must have wealth. 

LORD GORING. You underrate yourself, Robert. 
Believe me, without wealth you could have succeeded 
just as well. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. When I was old, perhaps. 



42 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

When I had lost my passion for power, or could not 
use it. When I was tired, worn out, disappointed. 
I wanted my success when I was young. Youth is 
the time for success. I couldn't wait. 

LORD GORING. Well, you certainly have had your 

•success .while you are still young. No one in our day 

has had such a brilliant success. Under-Secretary 

for Foreign Affairs at the age of forty — that's good 

enough for anyone, I should think. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. And if it is all taken away 
from me now.^ If I lose everything over a horrible 
scandal? If I am hounded from public life.^ 

LORD GORING. Robert, how could you have sold 
yourself for money? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Excitedly], I did not sell 
myself for money. I bought success at a great price. 
That is all. 

LORD GORING [Gravelif]. Yes; you certainly paid 
a great price for it. But what first made you think 
of doing such a thing? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Barou Amheim. 

LORD GORING. Damned scoundrel! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. No; hc was a man of a 
most subtle and refined intellect. A man of culture, 
charm, and distinction. One of the most intellectual 
men I ever met. 

LORD GORING. Ah! I prefer a gentlemanly fool 
any day. There is more to be said for stupidity than 
people imagine. Personally I have a great admiration 
for stupidity. It is a sort of fellow-feeling, I sup- 
pose. But how did he do it? Tell me the whole 
thing. / 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [ ThroTvs ktmself tfito an arm-' 
chair by the writing-table]. One night after dinner 
§t Lord Radley's the Baron began talking about suq- 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 43 

cess in modern life as something that one could re- 
duce to an absolutely definite science. With that 
wonderfully fascinating quiet voice of his he ex- 
pounded to us the most terrible of all philosophies^ the 
philosophy of power, preached to us the most marvel- 
lous of all gospels, the gospel of gold. I think he 
saw the effect he had produced on me, for some days 
afterwards he wrote and asked me to come and see 
him. He was living then in Park Lane, in the house 
Lord Woolcomb has now. I remember so well how, 
with a strange smile on his pale curved lips, he led 
me through his wonderful picture gallery, showed me 
his tapestries, his enamels, his jewels, his carved 
ivories, made me wonder at the strange loveliness of 
the luxury in which he lived; and then told me that 
luxury was nothing but a background, a painted scene 
in a play, and that power, power over other men, 
power over the world was the one thing worth having, 
the one supreme pleasure worth knowing, the one joy 
one never tired of, and that in our century only the 
rich possessed it. 

LORD GORING [With great deliberation], A thor- 
oughly shallow creed. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN [Risiug], I didn't think so 
then. I don't think so now. Wealth has given me 
enormous power. It gave me at the very outset of 
my life freedom, and freedom is everything. You 
have never been poor, and never known what ambition 
is. You cannot understand what a wonderful chance 
the Baron gave me. Such a chance as few men get. 

LORD GORING. Fortunately for them, if one is to 
judge by results. But tell me definitely, how did the 
Baron finally persuade you to — well, to do what you 
did? 

^IR ROBERT CH|LTERI|. WJi^n J was goiug awav h^ 



44 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

said to me that if I ever could give him any private 
information of real value he would make me a very 
rich man. I was dazed at the prospect he held out 
to me^ and my ambition and my desire for power were 
at that time boundless. Six weeks later certain 
private documents passed through my hands. 

LORD GORING [Keeping his eyes steadily -fixed on the 
carpet]. State documents? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. YcS. [lORD GORING sighs, 

then passes his hand across his forehead and looks 
up.] 

LORD GORING. I had HO idea that you^ of all men 
in the worlds could have been so weak^ Robert^ as to 
yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim held out 
to vou. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Weak? Oh^ I am sick of 
hearing that phrase. Sick of using it about others. 
Weak? Do you really think^ Arthur, that it is weak- 
ness that yields to temptation? I tell you that there 
are terrible temptations that it requires strength, 
strength and courage, to yield to. To stake all one's 
life on a single moment, to risk everything on one 
throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care 
not — ^there is no weakness in that. There is a horri- 
ble, a terrible courage. I had that courage. I sat 
down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim 
the letter this woman now holds. He made three- 
quarters of a million over the transaction. 

LORD GORING. And you? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I rcccivcd from the Baron 
£110,000. 

LORD GORING. You wcrc worth more, Robert. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. No ; that moncy gave me 
exactly what I wanted, power over others. I went 
into the House immediately. The Baron advised me 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 45 

in finance from time to time. Before ^ve years I 
had almost trebled my fortune. Since then every- 
thing that I have touched has turned out a success. 
In all things connected with money I have had a luck 
so extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost 
afraid. I remember having read somewhere^ in some 
strange book^ that when the gods wish to punish us 
they answer our prayers. 

LORD ooRiNo. But tell mc, Robert, did you never 
suffer any regret for what you had done? 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. No. I fclt that I had 
fought the century with its own weapons, and won. 

LORt) GORING [Sadly], You thought you had won? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I thoUght SO. [After O 

long pause,] Arthur, do you despise me for what I 
have told you? 

LORD GORING [With deep feeling in his voice], I 
am very sorry for you, Robert, very sorry indeed. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I dou't Say that I Suffered 
any remorse. I didn't. Not remorse in the ordinary, 
rather silly sense of the word. But I have paid con- 
science money many times. I had a wild hope that 
I might disarm destiny. The sum Baron Arnheim 
gave me I have distributed twice over in public 
charities since then. 

LORD GORING [LooJcing up]. In public charities? 
Dear me! what a lot of harm you must have done, 
Robert ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Oh, don't Say that, Arthur; 
don't talk like that. 

LORD GORING. Ncvcr mind what I say, Robert. I 
am always saying what I shouldn't say. In fact, I 
usually say what I really think. A great mistake 
nowadays. It makes one so liable to be misunder- 
stood. As regards this dreadful business, I will help 



46 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

you in whatever way I can. Of course you know 
that. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. Thank you^ Arthur^ thank 
you. But what is to be done ? What can be done ? 

LORD GORING [Leaning hack with his hands in his 
pockets]. Welly the English can't stand a man who 
Is always saying he is in the right, but they are very 
fond of a man who admits that he has been in the 
wrong. It is one of the best things in them. How- 
ever, in your case, Robert, a confession would not do. 
The money, if you will allow me to say so, is . . . 
awkward. Besides, if you did make a clean breast 
of the whole affair, you would never be able to talk 
morality again. And in England a man who can't 
talk morality twice a week to a large, popular, im- 
moral audience is quite over as a serious politician. 
There would be nothing left for him as a profession 
except Botany or the Church. A confession would 
be of no use. It would ruin vou. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. It would ruiu me. Arthur, 
the only thing for me to do now is to fight the thing 
out 

LORD GORING [Rising from his chair]. I was wait- 
ing for you to say that, Robert. It is the only thing 
to do now. And you must begin by telling your wife 
the whole story. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. That I will not do. 

LORD GORING. Robert, believe me, you are wrong. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I COuldu't do it. It WOuld 

kill her love for me. And now about this woman, this 
Mrs. Cheveley. How can I defend myself against 
her. You knew her before, Arthur, apparently. 

LOBD GORING. YcS. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Did you know her well? 
LORD GORING [Arranging his necktie]. So little 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 47 

that I got engaged to be married to her once^ when I 
was staying at the Tenbys*. The affair lasted for 
three days . . . nearly. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Why was it broken off? 

LORD GORING [Airily], Oh^ I forget. At leasts it 
makes no matter. By the way, have you tried her 
with money .^ She used to be confomidedly fond of 
money. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I offered her any sum she 
wanted. She refused. 

LORD GORING. Then the marvellous gospel of gold 
breaks down sometimes. The rich can't do every- 
thing, after all. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Not everything, I suppose 
you are right. Arthur, I feel that public disgrace is 
in store for me. I feel certain of it. I never knew 
what terror was before. I know it now. It is as if 
a hand of ice were laid upon one's heart. It is as if 
one's heart were beating itself to death in some emply 
hollow. 

LORD GORING [Striking the table], Robert, you 
must fight her. You must fight her. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. But hoW? 

LORD GORING. I Can't tell you how, at present. I 
have not the smallest idea. But everyone has some 
weak point. There is some flaw in each one of us. 
[Strolls over to the fireplace and looks at himself in 
the glass,] My father tells me that even I have 
faults. Perhaps I have. I don't know. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. In defending myself 
against Mrs. Cheveley, I have a right to use any 
weapon I can find, have I not? 

LORD GORING [Still looking in the glass]. In your 
place I don't think I should have the smallest scruple 



48 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

in doing so. She is thoroughly well able to take care 
of herself. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN [SiU dotvTi at the table and 
takes a pen in his hand] . Well^ I shall send a cipher 
telegram to the Embassy at Vienna^ to inquire if tiiere 
is anything known against her. There may be some 
secret scandal she might be afraid of. 

LORD GORING [Settling his buttonhole]. Oh, I 
should fancy Mrs. Cheveley is one of Uiose very 
modern women of our time who find a new scandal as 
becoming as a new bonnet, and air them both in the 
Park every afternoon at five-thirty. I am sure she 
adores scandals, and that the sorrow of her life at 
present is that she can't manage to have enough of 
them. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Writing]. Why do you say 
that? 

LORD GORING [ Turning round] . Well, she wore far 
too much rouge last night, and not quite enough 
clothes. That is always a sign of despair in a 
woman. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Striking a bell]. But it is 
worth while my wiring to Vienna, is it not? 

LORD GORING. It is always worth while asking a 
question, though it is not always worth while answer- 
ing one. 

[Enter mason.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Is Mr. Traff^rd in his 
room? 

MASON. Yes, Sir Robert. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Puts whot he hos Written 
into an envelope, which he then carefully closes]. 
Tell him to have this sent off in cipher at once. There 
must not be a moment's delay. 

MASON. Yes, Sir Robert 



Act 11] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 49 

SIR ROBERT CHILTBRN. Oh! just give that back to 
me again. 

[Writes something on the envelope* mason then 
goes out with the letter.] 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. She must havc had some 
cnrious hold over Baron Arnheim. I wonder what 
it was. 

LORD GORING [Smiling]. I wonder. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I will fight her to the deaths 
as long as my wife knows nothing. 

LORD GORING [Strongly], Oh^ fight in any case — 
in any case. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [With a gesture of despair]. 
If my wife found ont^ there would be little left to 
fight for. Well^ as soon as I hear from Vienna^ I 
shall let you know the result. It is a chance^ just a 
chance^ but I believe in it. And as I fought the age 
with its own weapons^ I vrill fight her with her weap- 
ons. It is only fair^ and she looks like a woman with 
a past^ doesn't she? 

LORD GORING. Most pretty women do. But there 
is a fashion in pasts just as there is a fashion in 
frocks. Perhaps Mrs. Cheveley's past is merely a 
slightly decollete one, and they are excessively popular 
nowadays. Besides, my dear Robert, I should not 
build too high hopes on frightening Mrs. Cheveley. 
I should not fancy Mrs. Cheveley is a woman who 
would be easily frightened. She has survived all her 
creditors, and she shows wonderful presence of mind. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Oh! I livC OR hopCS nOW. 

I clutch at every chance. I feel like a man on a ship 
that is sinking. The water is round my feet, and 
the very air is bitter with storm. Hush! I hear my 
wife's voice. 

[Enter lady chiltern in walking dress.] 



50 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

LADT CHILTERN. Good aftcmoon. Lord Goring! 

LORD GORING. Good aftemoon^ Lady Chiltem! 
Have you been in the Park? 

LAD7 CHILTERN. No: I havc jtist comc from the 
Woman's Liberal Association^ where, by the way, 
Robert, your name was received with loud applause, 
and now I have come in to have my tea. [To lord 
GORING.] You will wait and have some tea, won't 
you? 

LORD goring. I'll wait for a short time, thanks. 

LADY CHILTERN. I wiU be back in a moment. I 
am only going to take my hat off. 

LORD goring [In his most earnest manner]. Oh! 
please don't. It is so pretty. One of the prettiest 
hats I ever saw. I hope the Woman's Liberal Asso- 
ciation received it with loud applause. 

LADY CHILTERN [With a smile]. Wc' have much 
more important work to do than to look at each other's 
bonnets. Lord Goring. 

LORD GORING. Really? What sort of work? 

LADY CHILTERN. Oh! dull, uscful, delightful 
things. Factory Acts, Female Inspectors, the Eight 
Hours Bill, the Parliamentary Franchise. . . . 
Everything, in fact, that you would find thoroughly 
uninteresting. 

LORD GORING. And ncvcr bonnets? 

LADY CHILTERN [With mock indignation]. Never 
bonnets, never! 

[lady CHILTERN gocs out through the door leading 
to her boudoir.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Takes LORD goring's hand]. 
You have been a good friend to me, Arthur, a thor- 
oughly good friend. 

LORD GORING. I don't know that I have been able 
to do much for you, Robert, as yet. In fact, I have 



A*<II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 51 

not been able to do anything for you^ as far as I can 
see. I am thoroughly disappointed with myself. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. You have enabled me to 
tell you the truth. That is something. The truth 
has always stifled me. 

LORD ooRiNo. Ah! the truth is a thing I get rid 
of as soon as possible! Bad habit^ by the way. 
Makes one very unpopular at the club . . . with 
the older members. They call it being conceited. 
Perhaps it is. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I would to God that I had 
been able to tell the truth ... to live the truth. 
Ah! that is the great thing in life, to live the truth. 
[Sighs, and goes toward the door,] I'll see you soon 
again, Arthur, shan't I ? 

LORD GORING. Certainly. Whenever you like. I'm 
going to look in at the Bachelors' Ball to-night, unless 
I find something better to do. But I'll come round 
to-morrow morning. If you. should want me to-night 
by any chance, send round a note to Curzon Street. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Thank you. 

[As he reaches the door, lady chiltern enters 
from her boudoir.] 

LADY CHILTERN. You are not going, Robert.^ 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I have somc letters to write, 
dear. 

LADY CHILTERN [Going to Mm], You work too 
hard, Robert. * You seem never to think of yourself, 
and you are looking so tired. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. It is nothing dear, nothing. 

[He kisses her and goes out] 

LADY CHILTERN [To LORD GORINg] . Do sit down. 

I am so glad you have called. I want to talk to you 
about . . . well, not about bonnets, or the 
Woman's Liberal Association. You take far too much 



52 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

interest in the first subject^ and not nearly enough in 
the second. 

LORD ooRiNO. You Want to talk to me about Mrs. 
Cheveley ? 

LADY cHiLTERN. Ycs. You havc guessed it. 
After yon left last night I found out that what she 
had said was really true. Of course I made Robert 
write her a letter at once, withdrawing his promise. 

LORD GORING. So he gave me to understand. 

LADY CHILTERN. To havc kept it would have been 
the first stain on a career that has been stainless al- 
ways. Robert must be above reproach. He is not 
like other men. He cannot afford to do what other 
men do. [She looks at lord goring, who remains 
silent.] Don't you agree with me? You are Robert's 
greatest friend. You are our greatest friend. Lord 
Goring. No one, except myself, knows Robert better 
than you do. He has no secrets from me, and I 
don't think he has any from you. 

LORD goring. He certainly has no secrets from 
me. At least I don't think so. 

LADY CHILTERN. Then am I not right in my esti- 
mate of him? I know I am right. But speak to me 
frankly. 

LORD GORING [Looking straight at her]. Quite 
frankly? 

LADY CHILTERN. Surcly. You havc nothing to 
conceal, have you? 

LORD GORING. Nothing. But, my dear Lady Chil- 
tem, I think, if you will allow me to say so, that in 
practical life 

LADY CHILTERN [Smiling] . Of which you know so 
little, Lord Goring 

LORD GORING. Of which I know nothing by expe- 
rience, though I know something by observation. I 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 53 

think that in practical life there is something about 
success^ actual success^ that is a little unscrupulous, 
something about ambition that is unscrupulous always. 
Once a man has set his heart and soul on getting to 
a certain point, if he has to climb the crag, he climbs 
the crag; if he has to walk in the mire 

LADY CHILTBRN. Well? 

LORD GORING. He walks in the mire. Of course I 
am only talking generally about life. 

LADY CHiLTERN [Gravely], I hope so. Why do 
you look at me so strangely. Lord Goring? 

LORD GORING. Lady Chiltem, I have sometimes 
thought that • . • perhaps you are a little hard 
in some of your views on life. I think that . . . 
often you don't make sufficient allowances. In every 
nature there are elements of weakness, or worse than 
weakness. Supposing, for instance, that — that any 
public man, my father, or Lord Merton, or Robert, 
say had, years ago, written some foolish letter to 
some one • • • 

LADY CHILTERN. What do you mean by a foolish 
letter? 

LORD GORING. A letter gravely compromising one's 
position. I am only putting an imaginary case. 

LADY CHILTBRN. Robert is as incapable of doing 
a foolish thing as he is of doing a wrong thing. 

LORD GORING [After a long pause]. Nobody is 
incapable of doing a foolish thing. Nobody is in- 
capable of doing a wrong thing. 

LADY CHILTERN. Are you a Pessimist? What 
will the other dandies say. They will all have to go 
into mourning. 

LORD GORING [Rififig], No, Lady Chiltem, I am 
not a Pessimist. Indeed I am not sure that I quite 
know what Pessimism really means. All I do know is 



54 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

that life cannot be understood without much charity, 
cannot be lived without much charity. It is love, and 
not German philosophy, that is the true explanation 
of this world, whatever may be^the explanation of the 
next. And if you are ever in trouble. Lady Chiltem, 
trust me absolutely, and I will help you in every way 
I can. If you ever want me, ' come to me for my 
assistance, and you shall have it. Come at once to me. 

LADY CHILTERN [LooMfig at Mm in surprise]. Lord 
Goring, you are talking quite seriously. I don't think 
I ever heard you talk seriously before. 

LORD GORING [Laughtng], You must excuse me, 
Lady Chiltern. It won't occur again, if I can help 
it 

LADY CHILTERN. But I like you to be serious. 

[Enter mabel chiltern^ in the most ravishing 
frock.] 

MABEL chiltern. Dear Gertrude, don't say such a 
dreadful thing to Lord Goring. Seriousness would 
be very unbecommg to him. Good afternoon. Lord 
Goring ! Pray be as trivial as you can. 

LORD goring. I should like to, Miss Mabel, but I 
am afraid I am . • • a little out of practice this 
morning; and besides, I have to be going now. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Just wheu I havc come in ! What 
dreadful manners you have! I am sure you were 
very badly brought up. 

LORD GORING. I WaS. 

MABEL CHILTERN. I wish I had brought you up ! 

LORD GORING. I am SO sorry you didn't. 

MABEL CHILTERN. It is too late now, I suppose ^ 

LORD GORING [Smiling] . I am not sure. 
■ MABEL CHILTERN. Will you ride to-morrow morn- 
ing .> 

LORD GORING. Yes, at ten. 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 55 

MABEL CHILTERN. Don't forget 

LORD GORING. Of course I shan't. By the way^ 
Lady Chiltern, there is no list of your guests in "The 
Morning Post" of to-day. It has apparently been 
crowded out by the County Council, or the Lambeth 
Conference, or something equally boring. Could you 
let me have a list? I have a particular reason for ask- 
ing you. 

LADY CHILTERN. I am surc Mr. Trafford will be 
able to give you one. 

LORD GORING. Thanks, so much. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Tommy is the most useful per- 
son in London. 

LORD GORING [Turning to her]. And who is the 
most ornamental.^ 

MABEL CHILTERN [Triumphantly]. I am. 

LORD GORING. How clever of you to guess it! 
[Takes up his hat and cane,] Good-bye, Lady Chil- 
tern! You will remember what I said to you, won't 
you? 

LADY CHILTERN. Ycs; but I don't know why you 
said it to me. 

LORD GORING. I hardly know myself. Good-bye, 
Miss Mabel ! 

MABEL CHILTERN [With a little move of disappoint- 
ment].. I wish you were not going. I have had four 
wonderful adventures this morning; four and a half, 
in fact. You might stop and listen to some of them. 

LORD GORING. How Very selfish of you to have 
four and a half! There won't be any left for me. 

MABEL CHILTERN. I don't Want you to have any. 
They wonld not be good for you. 

LORD GORING. That is the first unkind thing you 
have ever said to me. How charmingly you said it! 
Ten to-morrow. 



56 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

MABEL CHILTERN. Sharp. 

LORD GORING. Quite sharp. But don't bring Mr. 
Trafford. 

MABEL CHILTERN [With a little toss of the heai\. 
Of course I shan't bring Tommy Trafford. Tommy 
Trafford is in great disgrace. 

LORD GORING. I am delighted to hear it. [Bows 
and goes outJ\ 

MABEL CHILTERN. Gertrudc^ I wish you would 
speak to Tommy Trafford. ' 

LADY CHILTERN. What has poor Mr. Trafford done 
this time? Robert says he is the best secretary he 
has ever had. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Wcll^ Tommy has proposed to 
me again. Tommy really does nothing but propose 
to me. He proposed to me last night in the music- 
room^ when I was quite unprotected^ as there was an 
elaborate trio going on. I didn't dare to make the 
smallest repartee^ I need hardly tell you. If I had^ it 
would have stopped the music at once. Musical peo- 
ple are so absurdly unreasonable. They always want 
one to be perfectly dumb at the very moment when 
one is longing to be absolutely deaf. Then he pro- 
posed to me in broad daylight this mornings in front 
of that dreadful statue of Achilles. Really^ the things 
that go on in front of that work of art are quite ap- 
palling. The police should interfere. At luncheon 
I saw by the glare in his eye that he was going to 
propose again^ and I just managed to check him in 
time by assuring him that I was a bimetallist. For- 
tunately I don't know what bimetallism means. Anci 
I don't believe anybody else does either. But the oL - 
servation crushed Tommy for ten minutes. He looken* 
quite shocked. And then Tommy is so anno3dng in 
the way he proposes. If he proposed at the top of hia 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 57 

voice^ I should not mind so much. That might pro- 
duce some effect on the public. But he does it in a 
horrid confidential way. When Tommy wants to be 
romantic he talks to one just like a doctor. I am 
very fond of Tommy^ but his methods of proposing 
are quite out of date. I wish, Gertrude, you would 
speak to him, and tell him that once a week is quite 
often enough to propose to anyone, and that it should 
always be done in a manner that attracts some at- 
tention. 

LAD7 CHiLTERN. Dear Mabel, don't talk like that. 
Besides, Robert thinks very highly of Mr. Trafford. 
He believes he has a brilliant future before him. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Oh! I Wouldn't marry a man 
vrith a future before him for anything under the sun. 

LAD7 CHILTERN. Mabel! 

MABEL CHILTERN. I kuow, dear. You married a 
man with a future, didn't you ? But then Robert was 
a genius, and you have a noble, self-sacrificing char- 
acter. You can stand geniuses. I have no character 
at all, and Robert is the only genius I could ever 
bear. As a rule, I think they are quite impossible. 
Geniuses talk so much, don't they ? Such a bad habit ! 
And they are always thinking about themselves, when 
I want them to be thinking about me. I must go 
round now and rehearse at Lady Basildon's. You 
remember, we are having tableaux, don't you? The 
Triumph of something, I don't know what! I hope 
it will be triumph of me. Only triumph I am reaUy 
interested in at present. [Kisses lady chiltern and 
goes out; then comes running hack.] Oh, Gertrude, 
do you know who is coming to see you? That dread- 
ful Mrs. Cheveley, in a most lovely gown. Did you 
ask her? 



«8 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

LADT CHiLTERN [Rising], Mrs. Cheveley! Com- 
ing to see me ? Impossible ! 

MABEL CHILTERN. I assure joti shc is coming up- 
stairs, as large as life and not nearly so natural. 

LADT CHILTERN. You need not wait, Mabel. Re- 
member, Lady Basildon is expecting you. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Oh! I must shakc hands with 
Lady Markby. She is delightful. I love being 
scolded by her. 

[Enter mason.] 

MASON. Lady Markby. Mrs. Cheveley. 

[Enter ladt markby and Mrs. chevelet.] 

LADY CHILTERN [Advancing to meet them]. Dear 
Lady Markby, how nice of you to come and see me! 
[Shakes hands with her, and bows somewhat distantly 
to MRS. CHEVELEY.] Won't you sit down, Mrs. 
Cheveley? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks. Isn't that Miss Chil- 
tern? I should like so much to know her. 

LADY CHILTERN. Mabel, Mrs. Cheveley wishes to 
know you. [mabel chiltern gives a little nod.] 

MRS. cheveley [Sitting down], I thought your 
frock so charming last night. Miss Chiltern. So sim- 
ple and • • • suitable. 

MABEL chiltern. Really? I must tell my dress- 
maker. It will be such a surprise to her. Good- 
bye, Lady Markby! 

LADY MARKBY. Going already ? 

MABEL chiltern. I am so sorry but I am obliged 
to. I am just off to rehearsal. I have got to stand 
on my head in some tableaux. 

LADY MARKBY. On your head, child? Oh! I hope 
not. I believe it is most unhealthy. [Takes a seat an 
the sofa next lady chiltern.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. But it is for an excellent char- 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 59 

ity: in aid of the Undeserving, the only people I am 
really interested in. I am the secretary, and Tommy 
Trafford is treasurer. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. And what is Lord Goring.^ 

MABEL CHiLTERN. Oh! Lord Goring is president. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. The post should suit him admir- 
ably, unless he has deteriorated since I knew him 
first. 

LADY MARKBY [Reflecting]. You are remarkably 
modern, MabeL A little too modern, perhaps. Noth- 
ing is so dangerous as being too modem. One is apt 
to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly. I have known 
many instances of it. 

MABEL CHILTERN. What a drcadf ul prospect ! 

LADY MARKBY. Ah! my dear, you need not be 
nervous. You will always be as pretty as possible. 
That is the best fashion there is, and the only fashion 
that England succeeds in setting. 

MABEL CHILTERN [ With o curtsey] . Thank you so 
mnch^ Lady Markby, for England . . . and myself. 
{Goes out,] 

LADY MARKBY [Turning to lady CHILTERN.] Dear 
Gertrude, we just called to know if Mrs. Cheveley's 
diamond brooch has been found. 

lady CHILTERN. Here? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Ycs. I misscd it when I got back 
to Claridge's, and I thought I might possibly have 
dropped it here. 

LADY CHILTERN. I havc heard nothing about it. 
But I will send for the butler and ask. [Touches the 
bell] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh, pray don't trouble. Lady 
Chiltem. I dare say I lost it at the Opera, before we 
came on here. 

LADY MARKBY. Ah, ycs, I supposc it must have 



60 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

been at the Opera. The fact is^ we all scramble and 
jostle so much nowadays that I wonder we have any- 
thing at all left on us at the end of an evening. I 
know myself that, when I am coming back from the 
Drawing Room^ I always feel as if I hadn't a shred on 
me^ except a small shred of decent reputation^ just 
enough to prevent the lower classes making painful 
observations through the windows of the carriage. 
The fact is that our Society is terribly overpopulated. 
Really^ some one should arrange a proper scheme of 
assisted emigration. It would do a great deal of 
good. 

MRS. . CHEVELET. I quitc agrcc with you. Lady 
Markby. It is nearly six years since I have been in 
London for the season, and I must say Society has 
become dreadfully mixed. One sees the oddest people 
everywhere. 

LADY MARKBY. That is quitc true, dear. But one 
needn't know them. I'm sure I don't know half the 
people who come to my house. Indeed, from all I 
hear, I shouldn't like to. 

[Enter mason.] 

LADY CHILTERN. What sort of a brooch was it that 
you lost, Mrs. Cheveley ? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. A diamond snake-brooch with a 
ruby, a rather large ruby. 

LADY MARKBY. I thought you Said there was a sap- 
phire on the head, dear? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Smiling], No, Lady Markby — a 
ruby. 

LADY MARKBY [Nodding her head]. And very be- 
coming, I am quite sure. 

LADY cHiLTERN. Has & Tuhj and diamond brooch 
been found in any of the rooms this morning. Mason ? 

MASON. No, my lady. 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 6l 

MRS. CHEVELEY. It really is of no consequence^ 
Lady Ghiltem. I am so sorry to have put you to any 
inconvenience. 

LADY CHiLTERN [Coldly], Oh^ it has been no in- 
convenience. That will do^ Mason. You can bring 
tea. 

LADY MARKBY. Wcll^ I must Say it is most annoy- 
ing to lose anything. I remember once at Bath^ years 
ago^ losing in the Pump Room an exceedingly hand- 
some cameo bracelet that Sir John had given me. I 
don't think he has ever given me anything since^ I am 
sorry to say. He has sadly degenerated. Really^ 
this horrid House of Commons quite ruins our hus- 
bands for us. I think the Lower House by far the 
greatest blow to a happy married life that there has 
been since that terrible thing called the Higher Edu- 
cation of Women was invented. 

LADY CHILTERN. Ah ! it is hcrcsy to say that in this 
house^ Lady Markby. Robert is a great champion of 
the Higher Education of Women^ and so^ I am afraid^ 
am I. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thc higher education of men is 
what I should like to see. Men need it so sadly. 

LADY MARKBY. They do^ dear. But I am afraid 
such a scheme would be quite unpractical. I don't 
think man has much capacity for development. He 
has got as far as he can^ and that is not far^ is it? 
With regard to women^ well, dear Gertrude, you be- 
long to the younger generation, and I am sure it is 
all right if you approve of it. In my time, of course, 
we were taught not to understand anything. That 
was the old system, and wonderfully interesting it 
was. I assure you that the amount of things I and my 
poor dear sister were taught not to understand was 



62 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

quite extraordinary. But modern women understand 
everything, I am told. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Except their husbands. That is 
the one thing the modern woman never understands. 

LADY MARKBY. And a Very good thing too, dear, I 
dare say. It might break up many a happy home if 
they did. Not yours, I need hardly say, Gertrude. 
You have married a pattern husband. I wish I could 
say as much for myself. But since Sir John has taken 
to attending the debates regularly, which he never 
used to do in the good old days, his language has be- 
come quite impossible. He always seems to think that 
he is addressing the House, and consequently when- 
ever he discusses the state of the agricultural labourer, 
or the Welsh Church, or something quite improper of 
that kind, I am obliged to send all the servants out of 
the room. It is not pleasant to see one's own butler, 
who has been with one for twenty-three years, actually 
blushing at the sideboard, and the footmen making 
contortions in corners like persons in circuses. I as- 
sure you my life will be quite ruined unless they send 
John at once to the Upper House. He won't take any 
interest in politics then, will he ? The House of Lords 
is so sensible. An assembly of gentlemen. But in 
his present state. Sir John is really a great trial. 
Why, this morning before breakfast was half over, he 
stood up on the hearthrug, put his hands in his pockets 
and appealed to the country at the top of his voice. I 
left the table as soon as I had my second cup of tea, 
I need hardly say. But his violent language could be 
heard all over the house! I trust, Gertrude, that Sir 
Robert is not like that? 

LADY CHILTERN. But I am vcry much interested in 
politics, Lady Markby. I love to hear Robert talk 
about Uiem. 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 6S 

j<ADY MARKBY. Wcll^ I hope he is not as devoted to 
Blue Books as Sir John is. I don't think they can 
be quite improving reading for anyone. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Languidly], 1 have never read a 
Blue Book. I prefer books ... in yellow covers. 

LADY MARKBY [Genially unconscious]. Yellow is a 
gayer colour, is it not? I used to wear yellow a good 
deal in my early days, and would do so now if Sir 
John was not so painfully personal in his observations, 
and a man on the question of dress is always ridiculous, 
is he not? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh, DO ! I think men are the only 
authorities on dress. 

LADY MARKBY. Really? One wouldn't say so from 
the sort of hats they wear, would one? 

[The hutler enters, followed by the footman. Tea 
is set on a small table close to lady chiltern.] 

LADY chiltern. May I give you some tea, Mrs. 
Cheveley? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks. [The butler hands mrs. 
CHEVELEY a cup of tea on a salver,] 

LADY CHILTERN. Somc tea, Lady Markby? 

LADY MARKBY. No, thauks, dear. [The servants go 
out.] The fact is, I have promised to go round for 
ten minutes to see poor Lady Brancaster, who is in 
very great trouble. Her daughter, quite a well- 
brought-up girl, too, has actually become engaged to 
be married to a curate in Shropshire. It is very sad, 
very sad indeed. I can't understand this modern 
mania for curates. In my time we girls saw them, of 
course, running about the place like rabbits. But 
we never took any notice of them, I need hardly say. 
But I am told that nowadays country society is quite 
honeycombed with them. I think it most irreligious. 
And then the eldest son has quarrelled with his father. 



64 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act 11 

and it is said that when they meet at the club Lord 
Brancaster always hides himself behind the money 
article in "The Times." However, 1 believe that is 
quite a common occurrence nowadays and that they 
have to take in extra copies of "The Times" at all the 
clubs in St. James's Street; there are so many sons 
who won't have anjiihing to do with their fathers, and 
so many fathers who won't speak to their sons. I 
think myself, it is very much to be regretted. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. So do I. Fathers have so much to 
learn from their sons nowadays. 

LADY MARKBY. Really, dear? What? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. The art of living. The only really 
Fine Art we have produced in modern times. 

LADY MARKBY \S}iah%ng her head]. Ah! I am 
afraid Lord Brancaster knew a good deal about that. 
More than his poor wife ever did. [Turning to lady 
CHiLTERN.] You know Lady Brancaster, don't you, 
dear? 

LADY CHILTERN. Just slightly. She was staying at 
Langton last autumn, when we were there. 

LADY MARKBY. Well, like all stout women, she looks 
the very picture of happiness, as no doubt you noticed. 
But there are many tragedies in her family, besides 
this affair of the curate. Her own sister, Mrs. Jekyll, 
had a most unhappy life ; through no fault of her own, 
I am sorry to say. She ultimately was so broken- 
hearted that she went into a convent, or on to the 
operatic stage, I forget which. No; I think it was 
decorative art-needlework she took up. I know she 
had lost all sense of pleasure in life. [Rising,] And 
Gertrude, if you will allow me, I shall leave Mrs. 
Cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a 
quarter of an hour. Or perhaps, dear Mrs. Cheveley, 
you wouldn't mind waiting in the carriage while I am 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 65 

with Lady Brancaster. As I intend it to be a visit 
of condolence^ I shan't stay long. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Rising], I don't mind waiting in 
the carriage at all^ provided there is somebody to 
look at one. 

LADY MARKBY. WcU^ I hear the curate is always 
prowling about the house. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I am afraid I am not fond of girl 
friends. 

LADY CHILTERN [Rising] , Oh, I hope Mrs. Cheve- 
ley will stay here a little. I should like to have a 
few minutes' conversation with her. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. How vcry kind of you. Lady 
Chiltem ! Believe me, nothing would give me greater 
pleasure. 

LADY MARKBY. Ah! uo doubt you both have many 
pleasant reminiscences of your schooldays to talk over 
together. Good-bye, dear Gertrude ! Shall I see you 
at Lady Bonar's to-night? She has discovered a 
wonderful new genius. He does . . . nothing at all, 
I believe. That is a great comfort, is it not? 

LADY CHILTERN. Robert and I are dining at home 
by ourselves to-night, and I don't think I shall go any- 
where afterwards. Robert, of course, will have to be 
in the House. But there is nothing interesting on. 

LADY MARKBY. Dining at home by yourselves? Is 
that quite prudent ? Ah, I forgot, your husband is an 
exception. Mine is the general rule, and nothing 
ages a woman so rapidly as having married the gener- 
al rule. [Exit lady markby.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Woudcrful womau. Lady Markby, 
isn't she? Talks more and says less than anybody I 
ever met. She is made to be a public speaker. Much 
more so than her husband, though he is a typical 
Englishman, always dull and usually violent. 



66 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

LADY CHiLTERN [Makes uo auswer, hut remains 
standing. There is a 'pause. Then the eyes of the 
two women meet, lady chiltern looks stem and 
pale. MRS. CHEVELEY seems rather amused]. Mrs. 
Cheveley, I think it is right to tell you quite frankly 
that^ had I known who you really were^ I should not 
have invited you to my house last night. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [With an impertinent smile]. 
Really? 

LADY CHILTERN. I could not havc donc so. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I scc that after all these years 
you have not changed a bit, Gertrude. 

LADY CHILTERN. I ucvcr change. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Elevating her eyebrows]. Then 
life has taught you nothing? 

LADY CHILTERN. It has taught me that a person 
who has once been guilty of a dishonest and dishon- 
ourable action may be guilty of it a second time, and 
should be shunned. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Would you apply that rule to 
everyone ? 

LADY CHILTERN. Ycs, to cvcryonc, without excep- 
tion. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Then I am sorry for you, Ger- 
trude, very sorry for you. 

LADY CHILTERN. You See uow, I am sure, that for 
many reasons any further acquaintance between us 
during your stay in London is quite impossible? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Leaning back in her chair]. Do 
you know, Gertrude, I don't mind your talking mo- 
rality a bit. Morality is simply the attitude we adopt 
towards people whom we personally dislike. You dis- 
like me. I am quite aware of that. And I have 
always detested you. And yet I have come here to 
do you a service. 



Act II] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 67 

LADY CHiLTERN [CoTitemptuouslif]. Like the serv- 
ice you wished to render my husband last nighty I 
suppose. Thank heaven^ I saved him from that. 

MR^. CHfiVELEY [Starting to her feet] . It was you 
who made him write that insolent letter to me.^ It 
was you who made him break his promise? 

LADY CHILTERN. YcS. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Then you must make him keep it. 
I give you till to-morrow morning — ^no more. If by 
that time your husband does not solemnly bind him- 
self to help me in this great scheme in which I am 
interested 



LADY CHILTERN. This fraudulent speculation 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Call it what you choose. I hold 
your husband in the hollow of my hand^ and if you 
are wise you will make him do what I tell him. 

LADY CHILTERN [Rising and going towards her]. 
You are impertinent. What has my husband to do 
with you? With a woman like you? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [With a bitter laugh]. In this 
world like meets with like. It is because your hus- 
band is himself fraudulent and dishonest that we pair 
so well together. Between you and him there are 
chasms. He and I are closer than friends. We are 
enemies linked together. The same sin binds us. 

LADY CHILTERN. How dare you class my husband 
with yourself? How dare you threaten him or me? 
Leave my house. You are unfit to enter it. 

[sir ROBERT CHILTERN cntcrs from behind. He 
hmrs his wife's last words, and sees to whom they are 
addressed. He grows deadly pale.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Your house ! A house bought 
with the price of dishonour. A house, everything in 
which has been paid for by fraud. [Turns round and 
sees SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.] Ask him what the origin 



68 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

of his fortune is ! Get him to tell you how he sold to 
a stockbroker a Cabinet secret. Learn from him to 
what you owe your position. 

LADY CHILTERN. It is not truc ! Robert! It is 
not true ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Pointing at him with outstretched 
finger]. Look at him! Can he deny it? Does he 
dare to? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Go ! Go at OUCe. YoU 

have done your worst now. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. My worst? I havc not yet fin- 
ished with you, with either of you. I give you both 
till to-morrow at noon. If by then you don't do what 
I bid you to do, the whole world shall know the origin 
of Robert Chiltern. 

[sir ROBERT CHILTERN strikes the bell. Enter 

MASON.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Show Mrs. Chcvdcy out. 

[mrs. CHEVELEY starts ; then hows with somewhat 
exaggerated politeness to lady chiltern^ who makes 
no sign of response. As she passes hy sm Robert 
CHILTERN, who is standing close to the door, she 
pauses for a moment and looks him straight in the 
face. She then goes out, followed hy the servant, 
who closes the door after him. The hushand and 
wife are left alone, lady chiltern stands like some 
one in a dreadful dream. Then she turns round and 
looks at her hushand. She looks at him with strange 
eyes, as though she was seeing him for the first time,] 

lady CHILTERN. You sold a Cabinet secret tor 
money ! You began your life with fraud ! You built 
up your career on dishonour! Oh, tell me it is not 
true ! Lie to me ! Lie to me ! Tell me it is not tme ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTKRN. WKftt this woman said is 



Act III AN IDEAL HUSBAND 69 

quite true. But, Gertrude, listen to me. You don't 
realize how I was tempted. Let me tell you the 
whole thing. [Goes towards her,] 

LADY CHiLTERN. Don't come near me. Don't touch 
me. I feel as if you had soiled me forever. Oh! 
what a mask you have been wearing all these years! 
A horrible painted mask! You sold yourself for 
money. Oh! a common thief were better. You put 
"yourself up to sale to the highest bidder ! You were 
bought in the market. You lied to the whole world. 
And yet you will not lie to me. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [RusMng towards her] . Ger- 
trude ! Gertrude ! 

LADT CHILTERN [Thrustiug htm back with out- 
stretched hands]. No, don't speak! Say nothing! 
Your voice wakes terrible memories — ^memories of 
things that made me love you — ^memories of words 
that made me love you — memories that now are hor- 
rible to me. And how I worshipped you ! You were 
to me something apart from common life, a thing 
pure, noble, honest, without stain. The world 
seemed to me finer because you were in it, and good- 
ness more real because you lived. And now — oh, 
when I think that I made of a man like you my ideal ! 
the ideal of my life ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. There was your mistake. 
There was vour error. The error all women commit. 
Why can't you women love us, faults and all? Why 
do you place us on monstrous pedestals? We have 
all feet of clay, women as well as men; but when we 
men love women, we love them knowing their weak- 
nesses, their follies, their imperfections, love them 
all the more, it may be, for that reason. It is not the 
perfect, but the imperfect, who have need of love. It 



70 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act II 

is when we are wounded by our own hands^ or by 
the hands of others, that love should come to cure us — 
else what use is love at all? All sins, except a sin 
against itself. Love should forgive. All lives, save 
loveless lives, true Love should pardon. A man's love 
is like that. It is wider, larger, more human than a 
woman's. Women think that they are making ideals 
of men. What they are making of us are false idols 
merely. You made your false idol of me, and I had 
not the courage to come down, show you my wounds, 
tell you my weaknesses. I was afraid that I might 
lose your love, as I have lost it now. And so, last 
night you ruined my life for me — ^yes, ruined it! 
What this woman asked of me was nothing compared 
to what she offered to me. She offered security, 
peace, stability. The sin of my youth, that I had 
thought was buried, rose up in front of me, hideous, 
horrible, with its hands at my throat. I could have 
killed it forever, sent it back into its tomb, destroyed 
its record, burned the one witness against me. You 
prevented me. No one but you, you know it. And 
now what is there before me but public disgrace, ruin, 
terrible shame, the mockery of the world, a lonely, 
dishonoured life, a lonely, dishonoured death, it may 
be, some day? Let women make no more ideals of 
men! let them not put them on altars and bow be- 
fore them, or they may ruin other lives as completely 
as you — you whom I have so wildly loved — ^have 
ruined mine ! 

[He passes from the room, lady chiltern rushes 
towards him, but the door is closed when she reaches 
it. Pale with anguish, bewildered, helpless, she 
sways like a plant in the water. Her hands, out- 
^tret<?hed, seem to tremble in the air like blossoms ifi

the wind. Then she flings herself down beside a sofa 
and buries her face. Her sobs are like the sobs of a 
chUd.] 



Act-drop. 



THIRD ACT 



ACT III 

Scene — The Library in lord ooring's house. An 
Adams room. On the right is the door leading into 
the hall. On the left, the door of the smoking-room. 
A pair of folding doors at the hack open into the 
drawing-room. The fire is lit. phipps, the butler, 
is arranging some newspapers on the writing-table. 
The distinction of phipps is his impassivity. He has 
been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler. The 
Sphinx is not so incommunicable. He is a ma^k with 
a manner. Of his intellectual or emotional life his^ 
tory knows nothing. He represents the dominance 
of form. 

[Enter lord goring in evening dress with a button^ 
hole. He is wearing a silk hat and Inverness cape. 
White-gloved, he carries a Louis Seise cane. His 
are all the delicate fopperies of Fashion. One sees 
that he stands in immediate relation to modem life, 
makes it indeed, and so masters it. He is the first 
well-dressed philosopher in the history of thought.] ' 

LORD GORING. Got my second buttonhole for me^ 
Phipps? 

PHIPPS. Yes^ my lord. [Takes his hat, cane and 
cape, and presents new buttonhole on salver.] 

LORD GORING. Rather distinguished things Phipps. 
I am the only person of the smallest importance in 
London at present who wears a buttonhole. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. I have observed that. 

^fpKP QORING [Taking out old buttonhole]. Yqm 

n 



76 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

see, Phipps, Fashion is what one wears oneself. What 
is unfashionable is what other people wear. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING. Just as Vulgarity is simply the con- 
duct of other people. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING [Putting in new buttonhole]. And 
falsehoods the truths of other people. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING. Other people are quite dreadful. 
The only possible society is oneself. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING. To lovc oucsclf is the beginning of 
a life-long romance, Phipps. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING [Looking at himself in the glass]. 
Don't think I quite like this buttonhole, Phipps. 
Makes me look a little too old. Makes me almost in 
the prime of life, eh, Phipps ? 

PHIPPS. I don't observe any alteration in your 
lordship's appearance. 

LORD GORING. YoU dou't, PhippS? 

PHIPPS. No, my lord. 

LORD GORING. I am Dot quitc sure. For the fntore 
a more trivial buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday even- 
ings. 

PHIPPS. I will speak to the florist, my lord. She 
has had a loss in her family lately, which perhaps 
accounts for the lack of triviality your lordship com- 
plains of in the buttonhole. 

LORD GORING. Extraordinary thing about the lower 
classes in England — ^they are always losing their re- 
lations. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord! Th^ are extremely for- 
tunate in that respect. 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 77 

LORD GORING [Tums Touud and looks at him. 
PHiPPS remains impassive^. Hum! Any letters^ 
Phipps? 

PHIPPS. Three^ my lord. [Hands letters on a 
salver. \ 

LORD GORING [Tokes letters'\. Want my cab round 
in twenty minutes, 

PHIPPS. Yes^ my lord. [Goes towards door.^ 

LORD GORING [Holds up letter in pink envelope]. 
Ahem! Phipps^ when did this letter arrive? 

PHIPPS. It was brought by hand just after your 
lordship went to the Club. 

LORD GORING. That will do. [Exit phipps.] Lady 
Chiltern's handwriting on Lady Chiltem's pink note- 
paper. That is rather curious. I thought Robert 
was to write. Won Jer what Lady Chiltem has got 
to say to me? [Sits at bureau and opens letter, and 
reads it] "I want you. I trust you. I am com- 
ing to you. Gertrude." [Puts down the letter with 
a puzzled look^ Then takes it up, and reads it again 
slowly,] "I want you. I trust you. I am coming 
to you." So she has found out everything! Poor 
woman! Poor woman! [Pulls out watch and looks 
at it.] But what an hour to call! Ten o'clock! I 
shall have to give up going to the Berkshires. How- 
ever, it is always nice to be expected, and not to 
arrive. I am not expected at the Bachelors', so I 
shall certainly go there. Well, I will make her stand 
by her husband. That is the only thing for her to 
do. That is the only thing for any woman to do. 
It is the growth of the moral sense in women that 
makes marriage such a hopeless, one-sided institution. 
Ten o'clock. She should be here soon. I must tell 
Phipps I am not in to anyone else. [Goes towards 
hell] 



78 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

[Enter phipps.] 

PHIPP8. Lord Caversham. 

LORD GORING. Oh, why will parents always appear 
at the wrong time? Some extraordinary mistake in 
nature, I suppose. [Enter lord caversham.] De- 
lighted to see you, my dear father. [Goes to meet 
him.] 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Take my cloak off. 

LORD GORING. Is it worth while, father? 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Of coursc it is worth while, sir. 
Which is the most comfortable chair? 

LORD GORING. This OHC, father. It is the chair I 
use myself, when I have visitors. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Thank ye. No draught, I hope, 
in this room? 

LORD GORING. No, father. 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Sitting down]. Glad to hear it. 
Can't stand draughts. No draughts at home. 

LORD GORING. Good many breezes, father. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. £h? Eh? Dou't Understand 
what you mean. Want to have a serious conversation 
with you, sir. 

LORD GORING. My dear father! At this hour? 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir, it is only ten o'clock. 
What is your objection to the hour? I think the hour 
is an admirable hour ! 

LORD GORING. Well, the fact is, father, this is not 
my day for talking seriously. I am very sorry, but 
it is not my day. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. What do you mean, sir? 

LORD GORING. During the season, father, I only 
talk seriously on the first Tuesday in every month, 
from four to seven. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, make it Tuesday, sir, 
make it Tuesday. 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 79 

LORD GORING. But it is after seven^ father^ and my 
doctor says I must not have any serious conversation 
after seven. It makes me talk in my sleep. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Talk in your sleep^ sir? What 
does that matter ? You are not married. 

LORD GORING. No^ father^ I am not married. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Hum ! That is what I have 
come to talk to you about^ sir. You have got to get 
married^ and at once. Why, when I was your age, 
sir, I had been an inconsolable widower for three 
months, and was already paying my addresses to 
your admirable mother. Damme, sir, it is your duty 
to get married. You can't be always living for pleas- 
ure. Every man of position is married nowadays. 
Bachelors are not fashionable any more. They are a 
damaged lot. Too much is known about them. You 
must get a wife, sir. Look where your friend Robert 
Chiltern has got to by probity, hard work, and a sen- 
sible marriage with a good woman. Why don't you 
imitate him, sir? Why don't you take him for your 
model ? 

LORD GORING. I think I shall, father. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. I wish you would, sir. Then I 
should be happy. At present I make your mother's 
life miserable on your account. You are heartless, 
sir, quite heartless. 

LORD GORING. I hope not, father. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. And it is high time for you to 
get married. You are thirty-four years of age, sir. 

LORD GORING. Yes, father, but I only admit to 
thirty-two — thirty-one and a half when I have a really 
good buttonhole. This buttonhole is not • . • trivial 
enough. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. I tell you you are thirty-four, 
sir. And there is a draught in your room, besides. 



80 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

which makes your conduct worse. Why did you tell 
me there was no draught sir? I feel a draught, sir, 
I feel it distinctly. 

LORD GORING. So do I, father. It is a dreadful 
draught. I will come and see you to-morrow, father. 
We can talk over anything you like. Let me help 
you on with your cloak, father. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. No, sir; I have called this even- 
ing for a definite purpose, and I am going to see it 
through at all costs to my health or yours. Put down 
my cloak, sir. 

LORD GORING. Certainly, father. But let us go 
into another room. [Rings bell.] There is a dread- 
ful draught here. [Enter phipps.] Phipps, is there 
a good fire in the smoking-room? 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING. Comc in there, father. Your 
sneezes are quite heart-rending. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir, I suppose I have a 
right to sneeze when I choose? 

LORD GORING [Apologeticidlif], Quite so, father. 
I was merely expressing sympaiiy. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Oh, damm sjrmpathy. There is 
a great deal too much of that sort of thing going on 
nowadays. 

LORD GORING. I quite agree with you, father. If 
there was less sympathy in the world there would be 
less trouble in ihe world. 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Gowg tofvards ihe smoking- 
room]. That is a paradox, sir. I hate paradoxes. 

LORD GORING. So do I, father. Everybody one 
meets is a paradox nowadays. It is a great bore. It 
makes society so obvious. 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Tumttig round, and looking 
at his son beneath his bushg eyebrows]. Do 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBANO 61 

you always really understand what you say, sir? 

LORD GORING [After some hesitation]. Yes, father, 
if I listen attentively. 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Indignantly], If you listen at- 
tentively! . . . Conceited young puppy! 

[Goes off grumbling into the smoking-room, phipps 
enters,] 

LORD GORING. Phipps, there is a lady coming to see 
me this evening on particular business. Show her 
into the drawing-room when she arrives. You under- 
stand? 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING. It is a matter of the gravest impor- 
tance, Phipps. 

PHIPPS. I understand, my lord. 

LORD GORING. No onc clsc is to be admitted, under 
any circumstances. 

PHIPPS. I understand, my lord. [Bell rings.] 

LORD GORING. Ah! that is probably the lady. I 
shall see her myself. 

[Just as he is going towards the door lord cavers- 
HAM enters from the smoking-room,] 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Well, sir? am I to wait attend- 
ance on you? 

LORD GORING [Considerable perplexed]. In a mo- 
ment, father. Do excuse me. [lord caversham' 
goes back.] Well, remember my instructions, Phipps 
— into that room. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

[lord goring goes into the smoking-room, harold, 
the footman, shows mrs. cheveley in. Lamia-like, 
she is in green and silver. She has a cloak of black 
satin, lined with dead rose-leaf silk.] 

HAROLD. What name, madam? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [To PHIPPS, who ttdvanccs towards 



85 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

her]» Is Lord Goring not here? I was told he was 
at home? 

PHipps. His lordship is engaged at present with 
Lord Caversham^ madam. 

[Turns a cold, glassy eye on harold^ foho at once 
retires.^ 

MRS. CHEVELEY [ To herself] . How very filial ! 

PHIPPS. His lordship told me to ask you^ madam^ 
to be kind enough to wait in the drawing-room for 
him. His lordship will come to you there. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [With a look of surprise]. Lord 
Goring expects me? 

PHIPPS. Yes, madam. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Are you quite sure? 

PHIPPS. His lordship told me that if a lady called 
I was to ask her to wait in the drawing-room. [Goes to 
the door of the drawing-room and opens it,] His 
lordship's directions on the subject were very precise. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [To hcrsclf]. How thoughtful of 
him! To expect the unexpected shows a thoroughly 
modern intellect. [Goes towards the drawing-room 
and looks in.] Ugh! How dreary a bachelor's 
drawing-room always looks. I shall have to alter all 
this. [ PHIPPS brings the lamp from the writing- 
table.] No, I don't care for that lamp. It is far too 
glaring. Light some candles. 

PHIPPS [Replaces lamp]. Certainly, madam. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I hopc the candlcs have very be- 
coming shades. 

PHIPPS. We have had no complaints about them, 
madam, as yet. 

[Passes into the drawing-room and begins to light 
the candles.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY [To hcrself], I wonder what wom- 
an he is waiting for to-night It will be deUgJitfiil to 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 8S 

catch him. Men always look so silly when they are 
caught. And they are always being caught. [Looks 
about room and approaches the writing-table.] What 
a very interesting room! What a very interesting 
picture! Wonder what his correspondence is like. 
[Takes up letters,] Oh, what a very uninteresting 
correspondence! Bills and cards, debts and dowa- 
gers! Who on earth writes to him on pink paper? 
How silly to write on pink paper! It looks like the 
beginning of a middle-class romance. Romance 
should never begin with sentiment. It should begin 
with science and end with a settlement. [Puts letter 
down, then takes it up again.] I know that hand- 
writing. That is Gertrude Chiltern's. I remember 
it perfectly. The ten commandments in every stroke 
of the pen, and the moral law all over the page. 
Wonder what Gertrude is writing to him about? Some- 
thing horrid about me, I suppose. How I detest that 
woman! [Reads it.] "I trust you. I want you. I 
am coming to you. Gertrude." **I trust you. I 
want you. I am coming to you." 

[A look of triumph comes over her face. She is 
just about to steal the letter, when phipps comes in.] 

PHiPPS. The candles in the drawing-room are lit, 
madam, as you directed. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thank you. [Rises hastily, and 
slips the letter under a large silver-cased blotting-book 
that is lying on the table.] 

PHIPPS. I trust the shades will be to your liking, 
madam. They are the most becoming we have. They 
are the same as his lordship uses himself when he is 
dressing for dinner. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [With a smile]. Then I am sure 
they will be perfectly right. 

PHIPPS [Gravely]. Thank you, madam.

Up.] 

[Enter lord goriho and lord cayersham.] 

LORD GORIHO [Expostulating], My dear father^ if 
I am to get married, sorely yon will allow me to 
choose the time^ place and person? Particolarfy the 
person* 

LORD CAYERSHAM [Tcstily]. That is a matter for 
me, sir. Yon wonld probably make a very poor 
choice. It is I who shonld be consulted, not yon. 
There is property at stake. It is not a matter for 
affection. Affection comes later on in married life. 

LORD GORING. Ycs. In married life affection 
comes when people thoronghly dislike each other, 
father, doesn't it? [Puts on lord catersham's doak 
for him.] 

lord cayersham. Certainly, sir. I mean certain- 
ly not, sir. Yon are talking Yery foolishly to-night. 
What I say is that marriage is a matter for common 
sense. 

LORD GORING. But womcD who haYc common sense 
are so curiously plain, father, aren't they? Of coarse 
I only speak from hearsay. 

LORD CAYERSHAM. No womau, plain or pretty^ has 
any common sense at all, sir. Common sense is the 
privilege of our sex. 

LORD GORING. Qulte SO. And we men are so sdf« 
sacrificing that we never use it^ do we, father? 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 85 

LORD CAVERSHAM. I use it^ sir. I use nothing else. 

LORD GORING. So my mother tells me. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. It is the secret of your mother's 
happiness. You are very heartless^ sir, very heart- 
less. 

LORD GORING. I hope not, father. 

[Goes out for a moment. Then returns, looking 
rather put out, with sir Robert chiltern.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. My dear Arthur, what a 
piece of good luck meeting you on the doorstep ! Your 
servant had just told me you were not at home. Hoiii 
extraordinary ! 

LORD GORING. The fact is, I am horribly busy to* 
night, Robert, and I gave orders I was not at home 
to anyone^ Even my father had a comparatively cold 
reception. He complained of a draught the whole 
time. N 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ah ! you must bc at home to 
me, Arthur. You are my best friend. Perhaps by 
to-morrow you will be my only friend. My wife 
has discovered everything. 

LORD GORING. Ah ! I gucsscd as much ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [I^ooking at him]. Really! 
How? 

LORD GORING [After some hesitation]. Oh, merely 
by something in the expression of your face as you 
came in. Who told her? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Mrs. Chcvcley herself. And 
the woman I love knows that I began my career with 
an act of low dishonesty, that I built up my life upon 
the sands of shame — ^that I sold, like a common huck- 
ster, the secret that had been intrusted to me as a 
man of honour. I thank heaven poor Lord Radley 
died without knowing that I betrayed him. I would 
to God I had died before I bad been so horribly 



86 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

tempted^ or had fallen so low. [Burying his face in 
his hands,] 

LORD GORING [After a pause]. You have heard 
nothing from Vienna yet, in answer to your wire? 

SIR ROBERT cHiLTERN [LooMng up]. Yes; I got a 
telegram from the first secretary at eight o'clock to- 
night. 

LORD GORING. Well? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Nothing is absolutely 
known against her. On the contrary, she occupies a 
rather high position in society. It is a sort of open 
secret that Baron Arnheim left her the greater por- 
tion of his immense fortune. Beyond that I can 
learn nothing. 

LORD GORING. She docsn't turn out to be a spy, 
then? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Oh! spics are of no use 
nowadays. Their profession is over. The news- 
papers do their work instead. 

LORD GORING. And thuudcriugly well they do it. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur, I am parched with 
thirst. May I ring for something? Some hock and 
seltzer? 

LORD GORING. Certainly. Let me. [Rings the 
bell] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Thauks ! I dou't know 
what to do, Arthur, I don't know what to do, and you 
are my only friend. But what a friend you are — 
the one friend I can trust. I can trust you absolutely, 
can't I ? 

[Enter phipps.] 

LORD GORING. My dear Robert, of course. Oh! 
[To PHIPPS.] Bring some hock and seltzer. 

PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING. And Phipps! 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 87 

PHipps. Yes, my lord. 

LORD ooRiNO. Will Jrou excuse me for a moment, 
Robert? I want to give some directions to my ser- 
vant. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Certainly. 

LORD OORINO. When that lady calls, tell her that I 
am not expected home this evening. Tell her that I 
have been suddenly called out of town. You under- 
stand.^ 

PHIPPS. The lady is in that room, my lord. You 
told me to show her into that room, my lord. 

LORD OORINO. You did perfectly right. [Exit 
PHiPPs] What a mess I am in. No; I think I shall 
get through it. I'll give her a lecture through the 
door. Awkward thing to manage, though. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur, tell me what I 
should do. My life seems to have crumbled about 
me. I am a ship without a rudder in a night without 
a star. 

LORD OORINO. Robert, you love your wife, don't 
you? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I lovc her morc than any- 
thing in the world. I used to think ambition the 
great thing. It is not. Love is the great thing in 
the world. There is nothing but love, and I love her. 
But I am defamed in her eyes. I am ignoble in her 
eyes. There is a wide gulf between us now. She 
has found me out, Arthur, she has found me out. 

LORD OORINO. Has she never in her life done some 
folly — some indiscretion — ^that she should not forgive 
your sin? 

SIR ROBERT' CHILTERN. My wif c ! Ncvcr! She 
does not know what weakness or temptation is. I am 
of clay like other men. She stands apart as good 
women do — ^pitiless in her perfection — cold and stern 



88 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

and without mercy. But I love her, Arthur. We 
are childless^ and I have no one else to love, no one 
else to love me. Perhaps if God had sent us children 
she might have been kinder to me. But God has given 
us a lonely house. And she has cut my heart in two. 
Don't let us talk of it. I was brutal to her this even- 
ing. But I suppose when sinners talk to saints they 
are brutal always. I said to her things that were 
hideously true, on my side, from my standpoint, from 
the standpoint of men. But don't let us talk of that. 

LORD GORING. Your wifc wiU forgive you. Per- 
haps at this moment she is forgiving you. She loves 
you, Robert. Why should she not forgive? 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. God grant it! God grant 
it! [Buries his face in his hands.] But there is 
something more I have to tell you, Arthur. 

[Enter phipps with drinks.] 

PHipps [Hands hock and seltzer to sm Robert 
CHILTERN ]. Hock and seltzer, sir. 

sir ROBERT CHILTERN. Thank you. 

LORD GORING. Is your Carriage here, Robert? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. No; I Walked from the 
club. 

LORD GORING. Sir Robcrt wiU take my cab, Phipps. 
PHIPPS. Yes, my lord. 

LORD GORING. Robert, you don't mind my sending 
you away? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur, you must let me 
stay for ^ve minutes. I have made up my mind what 
I am going to do to-night in the House. The debate 
on the Argentine Canal is to begin at eleven. [A 
chair falls in the drawing-room.] What is that? 

LORD GORING. Nothing. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I heard a chair fall in the 
next room. Some one has been listeninir. 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 89 

LORD GORING. No, no; there is no one there. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. There is some one. There 
are lights in the room, and the door is ajar. Some 
one has been listening to every secret of my life, 
Arthur, what does this mean? 

LORD GORING. Robert, you are excited, unnerved. 
I tell you there is no one in that room. Sit down, 
Robert. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Do you givc mc youT word 
that there is no one there .^ 

LORD GORING. YcS. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. YoUF WOrd of hoUOUr? 

[Sits down,] 

LORD GORING. YeS. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [i^M^^]. ArthUT, Ict me 866 

for myself. 

LORD GORING. No, UO. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. If there is no one there why 
should I not look in that room ? Arthur, you must let 
me go into that room and satisfy myself. Let me 
know that no eavesdropper has heard my life's secret. 
Arthur, you don't realize what I am going through. 

LORD GORING. Robert, this must stop. I have told 
you that there is no one in that room — ^that is enough. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [RuskcS to the doOT of the 

room] . It is not enough. I insist on going into this 
room. You have told me there is no one there, so 
what reason can you have for refusing me? 

LORD GORING. For God's sake, don't! There is 
some one there. Some one whom you must not see. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Ah, I thoUght SO ! 

LORD GORING. I f orbid you to enter that room. 
SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Stand back. My life is at 
stake. And I don't care who is there. I will know

who it Is to whom I have told my secret and my shame. 
[Enters room,] 

LORD GORING. Great Heaven ! his own wife ! 

[sir ROBERT CHiLTERN comes back, tvith a look of 
scorn and anger on his face*] ^ 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. What explanation have you 
to give me for the presence of that woman here ? 

LORD GORING. Robcrt^ I swcar to you on my hon- 
our that that lady is stainless and guiltless of all 
offence towards you. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. She Is a vile^ an infamous 
thing*! 

LORD GORING. Dou't Say that^ Robert:! It was for 
your sake she came here. It was to try and save yoo 
she came here. She loves you and no one else. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. You are mad. What have 
I to do with her intrigues with you? Let her remain 
your mistress! You are well suited to each other. 
She^ corrupt and shameful — ^you^ false as a friend, 
treacherous as an enemy even 

LORD GORING. It Is Dot truc, Robert. Before 
heaven, it is not true. In her presence and in yours 
I will explain alL 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Let me pass, sir. You 
have lied enough upon your word of honour. 

[sir ROBERT CHILTERN gOCS OUt LORD GORING 

rushes to the door of the drawing-room, when mrs. 
CHBVELE7 comes out, looking radiant and much 
amused,] 

MRS. CHBVBLBT [With a mock curtsey]. Good even- 
ing, Lord Goring! 

LORD GORING. Mrs. Chcveley! Great Heavens! 
. . . May I ask what you were doing in my drawing- 
room? 

MRS. CHEVELBT. Merely ligtening. I have a per- 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 91 

feet passion for listening through keyholes. One al- 
ways hears such wonderful things through them. 

LORD GORING. Docsu't that souud rather like 
tempting Providence? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh! surely Providence can resist 
temptation by this time. [Makes a sign to him to 
take her cloak off, which he does,] 

LORD GORING. I am glad you have called. I am 
going to give you some good advice. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Oh! pray don't. One should 
never give a woman anything that she can't wear in 
the evening. 

LORD GORING. I see you are quite as willful as you 
used to be. 

MRS. CHBYELET. Far morc! I have greatly im« 
proved. I have had more experience. 

LORD GORING. Too much experience is a dangerous 
thing. Pray have a cigarette. Half the pretty wom- 
en in London smoke cigarettes. Personally I prefer 
the other half. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks. I never smoke. My 
dressmaker wouldn't like it^ and a woman's first duty 
in life is to her dressmaker^ isn't it? What the sec- 
ond duty is^ no one has as yet discovered. 

LORD GORING. You havc comc here to sell me 
Robert Chiltern's letter, haven't you? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. To ofFcr it to you on conditions. 
How did you guess that? 

LORD GORING. Bccausc you haven't mentioned the 
subject. Have you got it with you? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Sitting down], Oh^ no! A well- 
made dress has no pockets. 

LORD GORING. What is your price for it? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. How absurdly English yon are! 
The English think that a cheque-book can solve every 



92 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

problem in life. Why, my dear Arthur, I have very 
much more money than you have, and quite as much as 
Robert Chiltern has got hold of. Money is not what 
I want. 

LORD ooRiNG. What do you want then, Mrs. 
Cheveley? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Why don't you call me Laura ? 

LORD GORiNo. I dou't like the name. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. You used to adorc it. 

LORD OORING. Ycs; that's why. [mrs. chbvblby 
motions to him to sit down beside her. He smUes, and 
does so,] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Arthur^ you loved me once. 

LORD GORING. YcS. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. And you asked me to be your 
wife. 

LORD GORING. That was the natural result of my 
loving you. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. And you threw me over because 
you saw, or said you saw, poor old Lord Mortlake 
trying to have a violent flirtation with me in the con- 
servatory at Tenby. 

LORD GORING. I am undcr the impression that my 
lawyer settled that matter with you on certain terms 
. . . dictated by yourself. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. At that time I was poor ; you were 
rich. 

LORD GORING. Quitc SO. That is why you pre- 
tended to love me. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Shrugging her shoulders]. Poor 
old Lord Mortlake, who had only two topics of con- 
versation, his gout and his wife. I never could quite 
make out which of the two he was talking about. He 
used the most horrible language about them both. 
Well, you were silly, Arthur. Why, Lord Mortlake 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND d$ 

was never an3i:hing more to me than an amusement. 
One of those utterly tedious amusements one only finds 
at an English country house on an English country 
Sunday. I don't tiiink anyone at all morally respon- 
sible for what he or she does at an English country 
house. 

LORD GORiKGw Ycs. I know lots of pcoplc think 
that. 

MRS. CHBVELBY. I loved joM, Arthur. 

LORD LORiNO. My dear Mrs. Cheveley^ you have 
always been far too clever to know anything about 
love. 

MRS. CHEYELBT. I did lovc you. And you loved 
me. You know you loved me; and love is a very won- 
derful thing. I suppose that when a man has once 
loved a woman^ he will do anything for her, except 
continue to love her? [Puts her hand on his.] 

LORD GORING [Taking his hand away quietly]. Yes: 
except that. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [After a pause]. I am tired of 
living abroad. I want to come back to London. I 
want to have a charming house here. I want to have 
a salon. If one could only teach the English how to 
talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be 
quite civilized. Besides, I have arrived at the ro- 
mantic stage. When I saw you last night at the 
Chiltems' I knew you were the only person I had 
ever cared for, if I ever have cared for anybody, 
Arthur. And so, on the morning of the day you 
marry me, I will give you Robert Chiltern's letter. 
That is my offer. I will give it to you now, if you 
promise to marry me. 

LORD GORING. NoW? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Smiling]. To-morrow. 
LORD GORING. Are you really serious?

Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 05 

MRS. CHEVELEY. As if anything could demoralize 
Robert Chiltern! You seem to forget that I know 
his real character. 

LORD GORING. What jou know about him is not Ids 
real character. It was an act of folly done in his 
youth^ dishonourable^ I admits shameful^ I admits un- 
worthy of him^ I admits and therefore . . . not his 
true character. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. How you men stand up for each 
other ! 

LORD GORING. How you womcu war against each 
other ! 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Bitterly], I only war against one 
woraan^ against Gertrude Chiltern. I hate her. I 
hate her now more than ever. 

LORD GORING. Bccausc you have brought a real 
tragedy into her life^ I suppose. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [With a snecr]. Oh, there is only 
one real tragedy in a woman's life. The fact that 
her past is always her lover, and her future inva- 
riably her husband. 

LORD GORING. Lady Chiltern knows nothing of the 
kind of life to which you are alluding. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. A womau whosc size in gloves is 
seven and three-quarters never knows much about 
an3rthing. You know Gertrude has always worn 
seven and three-quarters.^ That is one of the rea- 
sons why there was never any moral sympathy be- 
tween us. . . . Well, Arthur, I suppose this ro- 
mantic interview may be regarded as at an end. You 
admit it was romantic, don't you? For the privilege 
of being your wife I was ready to surrender a great 
prize, the climax of my diplomatic career. You de- 
cline. Very well. If Sir Robert doesn't uphold my 
Argentine scheme, I expose him. Voila tout. 



96 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

LORD ooRiNG. You mustn't do that. It would be 
vile^ horrible^ infamous. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Shrugging her shoulders]. Oh J 
don't use big words. They mean so little. It is a 
commercial transaction. That is all. There is no 
good mixing up sentimentality in it. I offered to sell 
Robert Chiltern a certain thing. If he won't pay 
me my price, he will have to pay the world a greater 
price. There is no more to be said. I must go. 
Good-bye. Won't you shake hands? 

LORD GORING. With you.^ No. Your transaction 
with Robert Chiltern may pass as a loathsome com- 
mercial transaction of a loathsome commercial age; 
but you seem to have forgotten that you who came 
here to-night to talk of love, you whose lips dese- 
crated the word love, you to whom the thing is a 
book closely sealed, went this afternoon to the house 
of one of the most noble and gentle women in the 
world to degrade her husband in her eyes, to try and 
kill her love for him, to put poison in her heart, and 
bitterness in her life, to break her idol and, it may be, 
spoil her soul. That I cannot forgive you. That 
was horrible. For that there can be no forgiveness. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Arthur, you are unjust to me. 
Believe me, you are quite unjust to me. I didn't go 
to taunt Gertrude at all. I had no idea of doing any- 
thing of the kind when I entered. I called with 
Lady Markby simply to ask whether an ornament, a 
jewel, that I lost somewhere last night, had been 
found at the Chilterns'. If you don't believe me, you 
can ask Lady Markby. She will tell you it is true. 
The scene that occurred happened after Lady Mark- 
by had left, and was really forced on me by Gertrude's 
rudeness and sneers. I called, oh! — ^a little out of 
malice if you like — but really to ask if a diamond 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 97 

brooch of mine had been found. That was the origin 
of the whole thing. 

LORD GORING. A diamond snake-brooch with a 
ruby? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Ycs. How do you know? 

LORD GORING. Bccausc it is found. In point of 
fact, I found it myself, and stupidly forgot to tell the 
butler anything about it as I was leaving. [Goes over 
to the writing-tahle and pulls out the drawers.] It is 
in this drawer. No, that one. This is the brooch, 
isn't it? [Holds up the brooch.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. I am so glad to get it back. 
It was ... a present. 

LORD GORING. Wou't you wcar it? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Certainly, if you pin it in. [lord 
GORING suddenly clasps it on her arm.] Why do you 
put it on as a bracelet? I never knew it could be 
worn as a bracelet. 

LORD GORING. Rcallv ? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Holding out her handsome arm]. 
No ; but it looks very well on me as a bracelet, doesn't 
it? 

LORD GORING. Ycs ; much better than when I saw 
it last. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. When did you see it last? 

LORD GORING [Calmly]. Oh, ten years ago, on 
Lady Berkshire, from whom you stole it. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Starting]. What do you mean? 

LORD GORING. I mean that you stole that orna- 
ment from my cousin, Mary Berkshire, to whom I 
gave it when she was married. Suspicion fell on a 
wretched servant, who was sent away in disgrace. I 
recognized it last night. I determined to say nothing 
about it till I had found the thief. I have found the 
thief now, and I have heard her own confession. 



98 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act III 

MRS. CHE VELEY [ TosstTig her head] . It is not true. 

LORD GORING. You know it is true. Why, thief is 
written across your face at this moment. 

MRS. CHETELEY. I wiU deny the whole affair from 
beginning to end. I will say that I have never seen 
this wretched thing, that it was never in my posses- 
sion. 

[mrs. CHETELEY tries to get the bracelet off her 
arm, hut fails, lord goring looks on amused. Her 
thin fingers tear at the jewel to no purpose. A curse 
breaks from her.] 

LORD goring. The drawback of stealing a thing, 
Mrs. Cheveley, is that one never knows how wonder- 
ful the thing that one steals is. You can't get that 
bracelet off, unless you know where the spring is. 
And I see you don't know where the spring is. It is 
rather difficult to find. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. You brutc ! You coward! [She 
tries again to unclasp the bracelet, but fails.] 

LORD GORING. Oh! don't use big words. They 
mean so little. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Again tears at the bracelet in a 
paroxysm of rage, with inarticulate sounds. Then 
stops, and looks at lord goring]. What are yon go- 
ing to do ? 

LORD GORING. I am going to ring for my servant. 
He is an admirable servant. Always comes in the mo- 
ment one rings for him. When he comes I will tell 
him to fetch the police. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Trembling']. The police? What 
for? 

LORD GORING. To-morrow the Berkshires will 
prosecute you. That is what the police are for. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Is now in an agony of physical 
terror. Her face is distorted. Her mouth tiwry. A 



Act III] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 99 

fnask has fallen from her. She is, for the moment, 
dreadful to look at]. Don't do that. I will do any- 
thing you want. Anything in the world you want. 

LORD GORING. Givc me Robert Chiltem's letter. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Stop ! Stop ! Let me have time 
to think. 

LORD GORING. Give me Robert Chiltem's letter. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I havc uot got It with me. I 
will give it to you to-morrow. 

LORD GORING. You know you are lying. Give it 
to me at once. [mrs. cheveley pulls the letter out, 
and hands it to him. She is horribly pale.] This is 
it.? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [In o hoarse voice]. Yes. 

LORD GORING [Takes the letter, examines it, sighs, 
and bums it over the lamp]. For so well-dressed a 
woman^ Mrs. Cheveley, you have moments of admir- 
able common sense. I congratulate you. 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Catches sight of LADY chiltern's 
letter, the cover of which is just showing from under 
the blotting'book]. Please get me a glass of water. 

LORD GORING. Certainly. [Goes to the comer of 
the room and pours out a glass of water. While his 
back is turned mrs. cheveley steals lady chiltern's 
letter. When lord goring returns with the glass she 
refuses it with a gesture.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thank you. Will you help me 
on with my cloak? 

LORD GORING. With plcasurc. [Puts her cloak 
on.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Thanks. I am never going to 
try to harm Robert Chiltern again. 

LORD GORING. Fortunatcly you have not the chance, 
Mrs. Cheveley.

* 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Well, if cvcn I had the chance, I 
wouldn't. On the contrary, I am going to render him 
a great service. 

LORD GORING. I am charmed to hear it. It is a 
reformation. 

MRS. CHEVELEY. Ycs. I Can't bear so upright a 
gentleman, so honourable an English gentleman, be- 
ing so shamefully deceived, and so 

LORD GORING. Well? 

MRS. CHEVELEY. I find that somehow Gertrude 
Chiltern's dying speech and confession has strayed 
into my pocket. 

LORD GORING. What do you mean? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [With a bitter note of triumph in 
her voice]. I mean that I am going to send Robert 
Chiltern the love letter his wife wrote to you to-night 

LORD GORING. Lovc letter? 

MRS. CHEVELEY [Laughing], "I want you. I 
trust you. I am coming to you. Gertrude." 

[lord goring rushes to the bureau and takes up 
the envelope, finds it empty, and turns round.] 

lord goring. You wretched woman, must you al- 
ways be thieving? Give me back that letter. I'll 
take it from you by force. You shall not leave my 
room till I have got it. 

[He rushes towards her, hut mrs. cheveley at once 
puts her hand on the electric hell that is on the table. 
The bell sounds with shrill reverberations, and phipps 
enters.] 

MRS. CHEVELEY [After a pause]. Lord Goring 
merely rang that you should show me out. Good- 
night, Lord Goring! 

[Goes out, followed by phipps. Her face is il- 
lumined with evU triumph. There is joy in her eyes.

interesting information. I feel like the latest edition 
of soipething or other. 

[Enter Servant] 

JAMES. Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office^

LORD GORING. Lady Chiltern not down yet.^ 

JAMES. Her ladyship has not yet left her room. 
Miss Chiltern has just come in from riding. 

LORD GORING [2^0 himself]. Ah! that is something. 

JAMES. Lord Caversham has been waiting some 
time in the library for Sir Robert. I told him your 
lordship was here. 

LORD GORING. Thank you. Would you kindly tell 
him I've gone? 

JAMES [Bowing] . I shall do so^ my lord. 

[Exit Servant.] 

LORD GORING. Really^ I don't want to meet my 
father three days running. It is a great deal too 
much excitement for any son. I hope to goodness he 
won't come up. Fathers should be neither seen nor 
heard. That is the only proper basis for family life.

LORD CAYERSHAM. WcU^ sir^ what are you doing 
here? Wasting your time as usual^ I suppose? 

LORD GORING [Throws down paper and rises]. My 
dear father, when one pays a visit it is for the pur- 
pose of wasting other people's time, not one's own. 

LORD CAYERSHAM. Have you been thinking over 
what I spoke to you about last night? 

LORD GORING. I have been thinking about nothing 
else. 

LORD CAYERSHAM. Engaged to be married yet? 

LORD GORING [Genially]. Not yet; but I hope to 
be before lunch-time. 

LORD CAYERSHAM [Causticalltf]. You can have till 
dinner-time if it would be of any convenience to you. 

LORD GORING. Thanks awfully, but I think I'd

you are serious or not. 

LORD GORING. Neither do I, father.

LORD CAYERSHAM. I supposc you havc read "The

LORD GORING [Airily]. "The Times"? Certainly 
not. I only read "The Morning Post." All that one 
should know about modem life is where the Duchesses 
are; anything else is quite demoralizing. 

LORD CAYERSHAM. Do you mean to say you have 
not read "The Times" leading article on Robert Chil- 
tem's career? 

LORD GORING. Great heavens ! No. What does it 
say? 

IsO^p CAYERSHAM. What should it say> sir? 



Act IV] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 107 

Everything complimentary^ of course. Chiltem's

one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in 
the House since Canning. 

LORD GORING. Ah! Ncvcr heard of Canning. 
Never wanted to. And did . . . did Chiltem uphold 
the scheme ? 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Uphold it^ sir? How little you 
know him! Why^ he denounced it roundly^ and the 
whole system of modern political finance. This

morality so common among foreign politicians." They 
will never say that of you, sir. 

LORD GORING. I sinccrcly hope not, father. How- 
ever, I am delighted at what you tell me about Robert, 
thoroughly delighted. It shows he has got pluck. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Hc has got morc than pluck, sir, 
he has got genius. 

LORD GORING. Ah! I prefer pluck. It is not so 
common, nowadays, as genius is. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. I wish you would go into Par- 
liament ? 

LORD GORING. My dear father, only people who 
look dull ever get into the House of Commons, and 
only people who are dull ever succeed there. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Why don't you try to do some- 
thing useful in life? 

LORD GORING. I am far too young. 

LORD CAVERSHAM [2^e«h7^]. I l^ate this affectation

of youths sir. It is a great deal too prevalent nowa- 
days. 

LORD GORING. Youth isn't an affectation. Youth is 
an art. 

LORD CAVBRSHAM. Why don't you propose to that 
pretty Miss Chiltem? 

LORD GORING. I am of a very nervous disposition^ 
especially in the morning. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. I don't supposc there is the 
smallest chance of her accepting you. 

LORD GORING. I dou't know how the betting stands 
to-day. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. If shc did accept you she would 
be the prettiest fool in England. 

LORD GORING. That is just what I should like to 
marry. A thoroughly sensible wife would reduce me 
to a condition of absolute idiocy in less than six 
months. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. You dou't dcservc her^ sir. 

LORD GORING. My dear father^ if we men married 
the women we deserved^ we should have a veiy bad 
time of it. 

[Enter mabel chiltern.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. Oh! . . How do you do^ Lord 
Caversham? I hope Lady Caversham is quite well? 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Lady Caversham is as usual^ as 
usual. 

LORD GORING. Good momiug^ Miss Mabel! 

MABEL CHILTERN [Taking fio notice at all of lord 
GORING, and addressing herself exclusively to lord 
caversham]. And Lady Caversham's bonnets . . . 
are they at all better ? 

LORD CAVERSHAM. They have had a serious re- 
lapse^ I am sorry to say. 

^oRp GORING. Qood mamincf. Mi89 Mab^ ! 



Act IV] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 109 

MABEL CHILTERN [To LORD CAVERSHAm]. I hopC 

an operation will not be necessary. 

LORD CAYERSHAM [Smiling at her pertness]. If it 
is we shall have to give Lady Caversham a narcotic. 
Otherwise she would never consent to have a feather 
touched. 

LORD GORING [With increased emphasis]. Good 
morning, Miss Mabel! 

MABEL CHILTERN [Turning round with feigned sur- 
prise]. Oh, are you here? Of course you under- 
stand that after your breaking your appointment I 
am never going to speak to you again. 

LORD GORING. Oh, plcase don't say such a thing. 
You are the one person in London I really like to 
have to listen to me. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Lord Goring, I never believe a 
single word that either you or I say to each other. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. You are quite right, my dear, 
quite right ... as far as he is concerned, I mean. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Do you think you could possibly 
make your son behave a little better occasionally? 
Just as a change. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. I regret to say. Miss Chiltern, 
that I have no influence at all over my son. I wish 
I had. If I had I know what I would make him do. 

MABEL CHILTERN. I am afraid that he has one of 
those terribly weak natures that are not susceptible 
to influence. 

LoftD CAVERSHAM. He is Very heartless, very heart- 
less. 

LORD GORING. It sccms to me that I am a little in 
the way here. 

MABEL CHILTERN. It is vcrv good for you to be 
in the way, and to know what people say of you be- 
hind your back. 



no AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act IV 

LORD OORINO. I don't at all like knowing what 
people say of me behind my back. It makes me far 
too conceited. 

LORD CAYERSHAM. After that, my dear, I really 
must bid you good morning. 

MABEL cHiLTERN. Oh ! I hopc you are not going to 
leave me all alone with Lord Goring.^ Especially at 
such an early hour in the day. 

LORD CAYERSHAM. I am afraid I can't take him 
with me to Downing Street. It is not the Prime 
Minister's day for seeing the unemployed. 

[Shakes hands with mabel chiltern^ takes up his 
hat and stick, and goes out, with a parting glare of 
indignation at lord goring.] 

MABEL CHILTERN [Takes up roses and begins to ar* 
range them in a howl on the table]. People who 
don't keep their appointments in the Park are horrid. 

LORD GORING. Detestable. 

MABEL CHILTERN. I am glad you admit it. But 
I wish you wouldn't look so pleased about it. 

LORD GORING. I Can't help it. I always look 
pleased when I am with you. 

MABEL CHILTERN [Sadly]. Then I suppose it is 
my duty to remain with you?, 

LORD GORING. Of coursc it is. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Well, my duty is a thing I never 
do, on principle. It always depresses me. So I am . 
afraid I must leave you. • 

LORD GORING. Plcase don% Miss MabeL I have 
something very particular to say to you. 

MABEL CHILTERN [Rapturousltf]. Oh! is it a pro- 
posal? 

LORD OORINO [Sofuewhat taken aback]* WeU^ yei^ 
it is— I am bomid to say it is. 



Act IV] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 111 

MABEL CHILTERN [With a Sigh of pleasure]. I am 
so glad. That makes the second to-day. 

LORD GORING [Indignantly], The second to-day? 
What conceited ass has been impertinent enough to 
dare to propose to you before I had proposed to you? 

MABEL CHILTERN. Tommy Trafford, of course. It 
is one of Tommy's days for proposing. He always 
proposes on Tuesdays and Thursdays, during the sea- 
son. 

LORD GORING. You didn't accept him, I hope? 

MABEL CHILTERN. I make it a rule never to ac- 
cept Tommy. That is why he goes on proposing. Of 
course, as you didn't turn up this morning, I very 
nearly said yes. It would have been an excellent 
lesson both for him and for you if I had. It would 
have taught you both better manners. 

LORD GORING. Oh! bothcr Tommy TraflPord, Tom- 
my is a silly little ass. I love you. 

MABEL CHILTERN. I kuow. And I think you 
might have mentioned it before. I am sure I have 
given you heaps of opportunities. 

LORD GORING. Mabel, do be serious. Please be 
serious. 

MABEL CHILTERN. Ah! that Is the sort of thing a 
man always says to a girl before he has been married 
to her. He never says it afterwards. 

LORD GORING [Taking hold of her hand], Mabel, 
I have told you that I love you. Can't you love me a 
little in return? 

MABEL CHILTERN. You silly Arthur! If you knew 
anything about . . . anything, which you don't, you 
would know that I adore you. Everyone in London 
knows it except you. It is a public scandal the way 
I adore you. I have been going about for the last six 
months telling the whole of society that I adore you«

MABEL CHiLTERN [Looking up at htm]. But you 
never have been refused yet by anybocty^ have you Ar-

LORD GORiNa Dear Mabel, while you are away, 
there are none. It makes me horribly dependent on 
yon. 

[Enter lady chiltern.] 

LADY CHILTERN. Good morning, dear. How 
pretty you are looking! 

MABEL CHILTERN. How pale you are looking, Ger- 
trude! It is most becoming! 

LADY CHILTERN. Good morning. Lord Goring! 

LORD OORINO [Botving], Good morning. Lady 
Chatem ! 

MABEL CHILTERN [Aside to LORD GORINo]. I shall 

be in the conservatory, under the second palm tree on 
the left. 

LORD GORING. Sccoud ou the left? 

MABEL CHILTERN [With a look of moch surprise^. 
Yes ; the usual palm tree. 

[Blows a hiss to him, unobserved by lady chil-; 
TERN, and goes ouf.] 

LORD goring. Lady Chiltern, I have a certain 
amount of very good news to tell you. Mrs. Cheveley 
gave me up Robert's letter last night, and I burned it. 
Robert is safe. 

LADY CHILTERN [Sinking on the sofa] . Safe ! Oh ! 
I am so glad of that. What a good friend you are to 
him — ^to us ! 

LORD GORING. Thcrc is only one person now that 
could be said to be in any danger. 

LADY CHILTERN. Who is that? 

LORD GORING [Sitting down beside her]. Yourself. 
LADY CHILTERN. I! In danger? What do you 
mean? 

LORD GORING. Danger is too great a word. It is 



114, AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act IV 

a word I should not have used. But I admit I have 
something to tell you that may distress you, that ter- 
ribly distresses me. Yesterday evening you wrote 
me a very beautiful, womanly letter, asking me for 
my help. You wrote to me as one of your oldest 
friends, one of your husband's oldest friends. Mrs. 
Cheveley stole that letter from my rooms. 

LADY CHILTERN. Well, what use is it to her? Why 
should she not have it.^ 

LORD GORING [Rising]. Lady Chiltem^ I will be 
quite frank with you. Mrs. Cheveley puts a certain 
construction on that letter and proposes to send it 
to your husband. 

LADY CHILTERN. But what constmction could she 
put on it? • . • Oh! not that! not that! If I in — in 
trouble, and wanting your help, trusting you, propose 
to come to you • . . that you may advise me . • • 
assist me • • • Oh! are there women so horrible as 
that . • • ? And she proposes to send it to my hus- 
band? Tell me what happened. Tell me all that 
happened. 

LORD GORING. Mrs. Chcveley was concealed in a 
room adjoining my library, without my knowledge. 
I thought that the person who was waiting in that 
room to see me was yourself. Robert came in unex- 
pectedly. A chair or something fell in the room. He 
forced his way in, and he discovered her. We had a 
terrible scene. I still thought it was you. He left 
me in anger. At the end of everything Mrs. Cheve- 
ley got possession of your letter — she stole it, when or 
how, I don't know. 

LADY CHILTERN. At what hour did this happen? 
LORD GORING. At half-past ten. And now I pro- 
pose that we tell Robert the whole thing at once. 
LADY CHILTERN [Looking at him with amazement 



Act IV] AN 1£)EAL HUgBA^f£) ii5 

that is almost terror]. You want me to tell Robert 
that the woman you expected was not Mrs. Cheveley, 
but myself? That it was I whom you thought was 
concealed in a room in your house^ at half-past ten 
o'clock at night? You want me to tell him that? 

LORD GORING. I think it is better that he should 
know the exact truth. 

LADY CHiLTERN [Rising]. Oh^ I couldn% I 
couldn't ! 

LORD GORING. May I do it? 

LADY CHILTERN. No. 

LORD GORING [Gravely]. You are wrong. Lady 
Chiltern. 

LADY CHILTERN. No. The letter must be inter- 
cepted. That is all. But how can I do it? Letters 
arrive for him every moment of the day. His secre- 
taries open them and hand them to him. I dare not 
ask the servants to bring me his letters. It would be 
impossible. Oh! why don't you tell me what to do? 

LORD GORING. Pray be calm. Lady Chiltern, and 
answer the questions I am going to put to you. You 
said his secretaries open his letters. 

LADY CHILTERN. YcS. 

LORD GORING. Who is with him to-day? Mr. 
Trafford, isn't it? 

LADY CHILTERN. No. Mr, Moutford, I think. 

LORD GORING. You cau trust him? 

LADY CHILTERN [ With o gesture of despair] . Oh ! 
how do I know? 

LORD GORING. Hc would do what you asked him, 
wouldn't he? 

LADY CHILTERN. I think SO. 

LORD GORING. Your letter was on pink paper. He 
could recognize it without reading it, couldn't he ? By 
the colour? 



116 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act IV 

LADT CHILTERN. I SUppOSe 80. 

LORD GORING. Is he in the house now? 

LADT CHILTERN. YcS. 

LORD GORING. Then I will go and see him myself^ 
and tell him that a certain letter^ written on pink 
paper^ is to he forwarded to Robert to-day^ and that 
at all costs it must not reach him. [Goes to the door, 
and opens it] Oh! Robert is coming upstairs with 
the letter in his hand. It has reached him already. 

LADT CHILTERN \Wiih a CTy of patii]. Oh! yon 
have saved his life ; what have you done with mine ! 

[Enter sir Robert chiltern. He has the letter 
in his hand, and is reading it. He comes towards his 
wife, not noticing lord gorino's presence.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. "I wsnt yoD. I trost yoo. 
I am coming to yon. Gertmde." Oh^ my lore? Is 
this true? Do you indeed trust me, and want me? 
If so, it was for me to come to you^ not for you to 
write of coming to me. This letter of yours, Ger- 
trude, makes me feel that nothing that the world may 
do can hurt me now. You want me, Gertrude? 

[lord goring, unseen by sir Robert chiltern,

take^ I suppose^ without looking at the handwriting 
on tiie envelope — and I read it — oh! I did not care 
what disgrace or punishment was in store for me^ I 
only thought you loved me still. 

LADY CHiLTERN. There is no disgrace in store for 
you, nor any public shame. Mrs. Cheveley has 
handed over to Lord Goring the document that was in 
her possession, and he has destroyed it. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Are you surc of this, Ger- 
trude? 

LADY CHILTERN. Ycs; Lord Goring has just told 
me. 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTEttN. Then I am safe ! Oh ! 
what a wonderful thing to be safe! For two days I 
have been in terror. I am safe now. How did Ar- 
thur destroy my letter? Tell me. 

LADY CHILTERN. He burncd it. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I wish I had sccu that one 
sin of my youth burning to ashes. How many men 
there are in modern life who would like to see their 
past burning to white ashes before them! Is Arthur 
still here? 

LADY CHILTERN. Ycs; he is in the conservatory. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I am SO glad uow I made 
that speech last night in the House, so glad. I made 
it thinking that public disgrace might be the result. 
But it has not been so. 

LADY CHILTERN. PubHc houour has been the re- 
sult. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I think SO. I fear so, al- 
most. For although I am safe from detection, al- 
though every proof against me is destroyed, I sup- 
pose, Gertrude ... I suppose I should retire from 
public life? [He looks anxiously at his wife.] 



118 AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act IV 

LADY CHILTERN [Eagerly], Oh yes, Robert, you 
should do that. It is your duty to do that. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. It 13 much to Surrender. 

LADY CHILTERN. No ; it will be much to gain. 

[sir ROBERT CHILTERN fvolks up and dowfi the room 
with a troubled expression. Then comes over to his 
wife, and puts his hand on her shoulder.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. And you would bc happy 
living somewhere alone with me, abroad perhaps, or 
in the country away from London, away from public 
lif e ? You would have no regrets ? 

LADY CHILTERN. Oh! uoue, Robcrt. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Sadly] . And your ambition 
for me? You used to be ambitious for me. 

LADY CHILTERN. Oh, my ambitiou ! I have none 
now, but that we two may love each other. It was 
your ambition that led you astray. Let us not talk 
about ambition. 

[lord GORING returns from the conservatory, look" 
ing very pleased with himself, and with an entirely 
new buttonhole that some one has made for him,] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Going towards him]. Ar- 
thur, I have to thank you for whiat you have done for 
me. I don't know how I can repay you. [Shakes 
hands with him,]

At the present moment, under the usual palm tree 
... I mean in the conservatory , , .

really makes a habit of turning up at the wrong mo- 
ment. It is very heartless of him, very heartless in- 
deed.

LORD CAVERSHAM. Good moming. Lady Chiltern! 
Warmest congratulations to you, Chiltern, on your 
brilliant speech last night. I have just left tfte Prime 
Minister, and you are to have the vacant seat in the

LORD CAVERSHAM. Ycs ; here is the Prime Minis- 
ter's letter, [Hands letter J\ 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Tahes letter and reads if]. 
A seat in the Cabinet ! 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Certainly, and you well deserve 
it too. You have got what we want so much in politi- 
cal life nowadays — ^high character, high moral tone, 
high principles. [To lord gorino.] Everything 
that you have not got, sir, and never will have. 

lord gorino. I don't like principles, father. I 
prefer prejudices. 

[sir ROBERT CHILTERN %s on the brink of accepting 
the Prime Minister's offer, when he sees his wife look* 
ing at him with her clear, candid eyes. He then re* 
atiees that it is impossible.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. 1 cannot acccpt ihis offer^ 
Lord Caversham* I have made up my mind to de- 
cline it. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. Decline it, sir! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. My intention is to retire at 
once from public life. 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Angrily]. Decline a seat in the 
Cabinet, and retire from public life? Never heard 
such damned nonsense in the whole course of my ex- 
istence. I beg your pardon. Lady Chiltern. Chil- 
tern, I beg your pardon. [To lord gorino.] Don't 
grin like that, sir. 

LOBD ooRiNa No, father.

LADY CHILTERN [Taking her husband's hand]. I 
admire him for it. I admire him immensely for it. 
I have never admired him so much before. He is 
finer than even I thought him. [To sir Robert 
CHILTERN.] You will go and write your letter to the 
Prime Minister now, won't you? Don't hesitate about 
it, Robert. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [ With a touch of hittemess] • 
I suppose I had better write it at once. Such offers 
are not repeated. I will ask you to excuse me for a

may I not?

Very sad indeed! And they are not an old family. 
Can't understand it. 

LORD GORING. It is Dot idiocy, father, I assure 
you. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. What is it then, sir? 

LORD GORING [After some hesitation]. Well, it is

what is called nowadays a high moral tone^ father. 
That is all.

The conservatory, father, the conservatory— there if 
some one there I want you to talk to. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. What about, sir? 

LORD GORING. About me, father. 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Grimly]. Not a subject on 
which much eloquence is possible. 

LORD GORING. No, father; but the lady is like me. 
She doesn't care much for eloquence in others. She 
thinks it a little loud. 

[lord CAVERSHAM goes tnto the contervatory. ladt 
CHiLTERN enters.] 

lord goring. Lady Chiltem, why are you playing 
Mrs. Chevelev's cards ? 

LADY CHILTERN [Startled]. I don't understand 
you. 

LORD GORING. Mrs. Chevelcy made an attempt to 
ruin your husband. Either to drive him from public 
life^ or to make him adopt a dishonourable position. 
From the latter tragedy you saved him. The former 
you are now thrusting on him. Why should you do 
him the wrong Mrs. Cheveley tried to do and failed? 

LADY CHILTERN. Lord Goring! 

LORD GORING [PulUng himself together for a great 
effort, and showing the philosophy that underlies the 
dandy]. Lady Chiltem, allow me. You wrote me

Judge uf^ bat to forgive us when we need forgiveness. 
Pardon, not punishment, is their missifln. Why 
should you scourge him with rods for a sin done in 
bis youth, before he knew you, before he knew him- 
self? A man's life is of more value than a woman's. 
It has larger issues, wider scope, greater amhiti<His. 
A woman's life revolves in curves of emotkms. It is 
upon lines of intellect that a man's life progresses. 
Don't make jsny terrible mistake, La^ Chilfcem. A 
woman who can keep a man's love, and love him in 
return, has done all the world wants of women, or 
should want of them. 

LADY CHiLTERN [Troubled and hesUaiing], But it 
is my husband himself who wishes to retire from pub- 
lic life. He feels it is his duty. It was he who first 
said so. 

LORD ooRiNo. Rather than lose your love, Robert 
would do anything^ wreck his whole career, as he is 
on the brink of doing now. He is making for you 
ft terrible sacrifice. Take my advice. Lady Chiltem, 
and do not accept a sacrifice so great. If you do, you 
Will live to repent it bitterly. We men and women 
Mre not made to accept such Mt* ^ ^ from each other. 



Act IV] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 128 

We are not worthy of them. Besides^ Robert has been 
punished enough. 

LADY CHILTERN. We have both been punished. I 
set him up too high. 

LORD GORING [With deep feeling in his voice]. Do 
not for that reason set him down now too low. If he 
has fallen from his altar^ do not thrust him into the 
mire. Failure to Robert would be the very mire of 
shame. Power is his passion. He would lose every- 
thing^ even his power to feel love. Your husband's 
life is at this moment in your hands^ your husband's 
love is in your hands. Don't mar both for him. 

[Enter sir Robert chilterx.] 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Gertrude^ here is the draft 
of my letter. Shall I read it to you ? 

LADY CHILTERN. Let me see it. 

[sir ROBERT hands her the letter. She reads it, 
and then, with a gesture of passion, tears it up.] 

sir ROBERT CHILTERN. What are you doing? 

LADY CHILTERN. A mau's life is of more value 
than a woman's. It has larger issues^ wider scope, 
greater ambitions. Our lives revolve in curves of 
emotions. It is upon lines of intellect that a man's 
life progresses. I have just learnt this, and much 
else with it, from Lord Goring. And I will not spoil 
your life for you, nor see you spoil it as a sacrifice to 
me, a useless sacrifice ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Gcrtrudc ! Gcrtrudc ! 

LADY CHILTERN. You can forgct. Men easily for- 
get. And I forgive. That is how women help the 
world. I see that now. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN [Deeply overcome hy emo- 
tion, embraces her]. My wife! my wife! [To lord 
ooRiNG.] Arthur^ it seems that I am always to be in 
your debt. 



lU AN IDEAL HUSBAND [Act IV 

LORD GORING. Oh dcRT no^ Robert. Your debt ii 
to Lady Chiltem^ not to me ! 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. I owe jou much. And now 
tell me what yon were going to ask me just now as 
Lord Caversham came in. 

LORD GORING. Robert^ you are yomr sister's guar- 
dian^ and I want your consent to my marriage with 
her. That is alL 

LADY CHILTERN. Oh^ I am SO glad! I am so glad! 
[Shakes hands tvith lord goring.] 

LORD GORING. Thank you^ Lady Chiltem. 

sm ROBERT CHILTERN [With a trouhUd looh^. VLj 
sister to be your wife? 

LORD GORING. YcS. 

sm ROBERT CHILTERN [Speaking with great firm" 
ness] . Arthur^ I am very sorry^ but the thing is quite 
out of the question. I have to think of Mabel's fu- 
ture happiness. And I don't think her happiness 
would be safe in your hands. And I cannot have her 
sacrificed ! 

LORD GORING. Sacrificed! 

sm ROBERT CHILTERN. Ycs, Utterly sacrificed. 
Loveless marriages are horrible. But there is one 
thing worse than an absolutely loveless marriage. A 
marriage in which there is love^ but on one side 
only; faith, but on one side only; devotion, but on 
one side only, and in which of the two hearts one is 
sure to be broken. 

LORD GORING. But I lovc Mabel. No other woman 
has any place in my life. 

LADY CHILTERN. Robert, if they love each other, 
why should they not be married ? 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Arthur cannot bring Mabel 
the love that she deserves. 



Act IV] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 125 

LORD GORING. What reason have you for saying 
that? 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN [After a pause]. Do you 
really require me to tell you? 

LORD GORING. Certainly I do. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. As you choosc. When I 
called on you yesterday evening I found Mrs. Chevc- 
ley concealed in your rooms. It was between ten and 
eleven o'clock at night. I do not wish to say any- 
thing more. Your relations with Mrs. Cheveley have, 
as I said to you last nighty nothing whatsoever to do 
with me. I know you were engaged to be married to 
her once. The fascination she exercised over yon 
then seems to have returned. You spoke to me last 
night of her as a woman pure and stainless^ a woman 
whom you respected and honoured. That may be so. 
But I cannot give my sister's life into your hands. It 
would be wrong of me. It would be unjust, infamous- 
ly unjust to her. 

LORD GORING. I havc nothing more to say. 

LADY CHILTERN. Robert, it was not Mrs. Cheveley 
whom Lord Goring expected last night. 

SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. Not Mrs. Chevclcy ! Who 
was it then ? 

LORD GORING. Lady Chiltern! 

LADY CHILTERN. It was your own wife. Robert, 
yesterday afternoon Lord Goring told me that if ever 
I was in trouble I could come to him for help, as he 
was our oldest and best friend. Later on, after that 
terrible scene in this room, I wrote to him telling him 
that I trusted him, that I had need of him, that I was 
coming to him for help apd advice, [sir Robert 
CHILTERN takes the letter out of his pocket.] Yes, 
that letter. I didn't go to Lord Goring's, after all. 
I felt that it is from ourselves alone that help can

come. Pride made me think that. Mrs. Cheveley 
went. She stole my letter and sent it anonymously 
to you this mornings that you should think . . . Oh ! 
Robert^ I cannot tell you what she wished you to 
think. . . . 

SIR ROBERT CHiLTERN. What! Had I fallen so 
low in your eyes that you thought that even for a mo- 
ment I could have doubted your goodness ? Gertrude, 
Gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good 
things, and sin can never touch you. Arthur, you can 
go to Mabel, and you have my best wishes ! Oh ! stop 
a moment. There is no name at the beginning of this 
letter. The brilliant Mrs. Cheveley does not seem to 
have noticed that. There should be a name. 

LADY CHILTERN. Let me write yours. It is you I 
trust and need. You and none else. 

LORD GORING. Well, really, Lady Chiltem, I think 
I should have back my own letter. 

LADY CHILTERN [Smiling], No; you shall have 
Mabel. [Takes the letter and writes her husband's 
name on it,] 

LORD GORING. Well, I hopc shc hasn't changed her 
mind. It's nearly twenty minutes since I saw her 
last. 

[Enter mabel chiltern and lord caversham.] 

MABEL CHILTERN. Lord Goriug, I think your 
father's conversation much more improving than yours. 
I am only going to talk to Lord Caversham in the fu- 
ture, and always under the usual palm tree. 

LORD GORING. Darling! [Kisses her,] 

LORD CAVERSHAM [Considerably aback]. What 
does this mean, sir? You don't mean to say that this 
charming, clever young lady has been so foolish as to 
accept you ? 



Act IV] AN IDEAL HUSBAND 127 

LORD GORING. Certainly, father! And Chiltem's 
been wise enough to accept a seat in the Cabinet. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. I am vcry glad to hear that^ 
Chiltern ... I congratulate you, sir. If the country 
doesn't go to the dogs or the Radicals, we shall have 
you Prime Minister, some day. 

[Enter Mason.] 

MASON. Luncheon is on the table, my Lady! 

[mason goes out] 

LADY CHILTERN. You'll stop to lunchcon, Lord 
Caversham, won't you? 

LORD CAVERSHAM. With pleasure, and I'll drive you 
down to Downing Street afterwards, Chiltern. You 
have a great future before you, a great future. Wish 
I could say the same for you, sir. [To lord goring.] 
But your career will have to be entirely domestic. 

lord goring. Yes, father, I prefer it domestic. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. And if you don't make this 
young ladv an ideal husband, I'll cut you off with a 
shilling. 

MABEL CHILTERN. An ideal husband ! Oh, I don't 
think I should like that. It sounds like something in 
the next world. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. What do you want him to be 
then, dear? 

MABEL CHILTERN. He Can be what he chooses. All 
I want is to be ... to be ... oh! a real wife to 
him. 

LORD CAVERSHAM. UpoD my word, there is a good 
deal of common sense in that. Lady Chiltern. 

[Thei/ all go out except sir robert chiltern. He 
sinks into a chair, wrapt in thought. After a little 
time LADY CHILTERN retums to look for him,] 

LADY CHILTERN [Leaning over the back of the 
chair]. Aren't you coming in, Robert?
