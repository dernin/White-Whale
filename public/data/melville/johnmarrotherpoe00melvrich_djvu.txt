Introductory Note 



JVIelville's verse printed for the most part 
privately in small editions from middle life 
onward after his great prose work had been 
written, taken as a whole, is of an amateurish 
and uneven quality. In it, however, that love- 
able freslmess of personality, which his philo- 
sophical dejection never quenched, is every- 
where in evidence. It is clear that he did not 
set himself to master the poet's art, yet through 
the mask of conventional verse which often 
falls into doggerel, the voice of a true poet is 
heard. In selecting the pieces for this volume 
I have put in the vigorous sea verses of John 
Marr in their entirety and added those others 
from his Battle Pieces, Timoleon, etc., that 
best indicate the quality of their author's per- 
sonality. The prose Supplement to Battle 
Pieces has been included because it does so 
much to explain the feeling of his war verse 
and further because it is such a remarkably 
wise and clear commentary upon those con- 
fused and troublous days of post-war recon- 
struction. H. C.

JOHN MARK AND 
OTHER SAILORS 



JOHN MARK AND 
OTHER SAILORS 

Since as in night's deck-watch ye show, 
Why> lads, so silent here to me. 
Your watchmate of times long ago? 
Once, for all the darkhng sea. 
You yom' voices raised how clearly, 
Striking in when tempest sung; 
Hoisting up the storm-sail cheerly, 
Life is storm — let storm! you rung. 
Taking things as fated merely, 
Childlike though the world ye spanned ; 
Nor holding unto life too dearly, 
Ye who held your lives in hand — 
Skimmers, who on oceans four 
Petrels were, and larks ashore. 

O, not from memory lightly flung, 
Forgot, like strains no more availing. 
The heart to music haughtier strung ; 
Nay, frequent near me, never staking. 
Whose good feeling kept ye young. 
Like tides that enter creek or stream. 
Ye come, ye visit me, or seem 
Swimming out from seas of faces. 



[15] 



Alien myriads memory traces, 
To enfold me in a dream ! 

I yearn as ye. But rafts that strain. 
Parted, shall they lock again? 
Twined we were, entwined, then riven, 
Ever to new embracements driven. 
Shifting gulf -weed of the main ! 
And how if one here shift no more, 
Lodged by the flinging surge ashore ? 
Nor less, as now, in eve's decline. 
Your shadowy fellowship is mine. 
Ye float around me, form and feature :— 
Tattooings, ear-rings, love-locks curled; 
Barbarians of man's simpler nature. 
Unworldly servers of the world. 
Yea, present all, and dear to me. 
Though shades, or scouring China's sea. 

Wliither, whither, merchant-sailors. 
Whitherward now in roaring gales? 
Competing still, ye huntsman- whalers. 
In leviathan's wake what boat prevails ? 
And man-of-war's men, whereaway? 
If now no dinned drum beat to quarters 
On the wilds of midnight waters — 



[IG] 



Foemen looming through the spray ; 

Do yet your gangway lanterns, streaming, 

Vainly strive to pierce below. 

When, tilted from the slant plank gleaming, 

A brother you see to darkness go? 

But, gunmates lashed in shotted canvas. 

If where long watch-below ye keep. 

Never the shrill "All hands up hammocks T" 

Breaks the spell that charms your sleep. 

And summoning trumps might vainly call, 

And booming guns implore — 

A beat, a heart-beat musters all. 

One heart-beat at heart-core. 

It musters. But to clasp, retain; 

To see you at the halyards main — 

To hear your chorus once again ! 



[17] 



BRIDEGROOM DICK 

1876 

Sunning ourselves in October on a day 

Balmy as spring, though the year was in decay, 

I lading my pipe, she stirring her tea, 

My old woman she says to me, 

"Feel ye, old man, how the season mellows?" 

And why should I not, blessed heart alive, 

Here mellowing myself, past sixty-five, 

To think o' the May-time o' pennoned young 

fellows 
This stripped old hulk here for years may 

survive. 

Ere yet, long ago, we were spliced, Bonny Blue, 
( Silvery it gleams down the moon-glade o' time, 
Ah, sugar in the bowl and berries in the prime ! ) 
Coxswain I o' the Commodore's crew, — 
Under me the fellows that manned his fine gig. 
Spinning him ashore, a king in full fig. 
Chirrupy even when crosses rubbed me. 
Bridegroom Dick lieutenants dubbed me. 
Pleasant at a yarn, Bob o' Linkum in a song. 
Diligent in duty and nattily arrayed. 



[18] 



Favored I was, wife, and fleeted right along; 
And though but a tot for such a tall grade, 
A high quartermaster at last I was made. 

All this, old lassie, you have heard before. 
But you listen again for the sake e'en o' me ; 
No babble stales o' the good times o' yore 
To Joan, if Darby the babbler be. 

Babbler? — O' what? Addled brains, they 

forget ! 
O — quartermaster I ; yes, the signals set, 
Hoisted the ensign, mended it when frayed, 
Polished up the binnacle, minded the helm. 
And prompt every order blithely obeyed. 
To me would the officers say a word cheery — 
Break through the starch o' the quarter-deck 

realm ; 
His coxswain late, so the Commodore's pet. 
Ay, and in night-watches long and weary, 
Bored nigh to death with the navy etiquette. 
Yearning, too, for fun, some younker, a cadet, 
Dropping for time each vain bumptious trick, 
Boy-like would unbend to Bridegroom Dick. 



[19] 



But a limit there was — a check, d' ye see : 
Those fine young aristocrats knew their degree. 

Well, stationed aft where their lordships 

keep, — 
Seldom going forward excepting to sleep, — 
I, boozing now on by-gone years. 
My betters recall along with my peers. 
Recall them? Wife, but I see them plain: 
Alive, alert, every man stirs again. 
Ay, and again on the lee-side pacing, 
My spy-glass carrying, a truncheon in show, 
Turning at the taffrail, my footsteps retracing, 
Proud in my duty, again me thinks I go. 
And Dave, Dainty Dave, I mark where he 

stands, 
Our trim sailing-master, to time the high-noon, 
That thingumbob sextant perplexing eyes and 

hands, 
Squinting at the sun, or twigging o' the moon; 
Then, touching his cap to Old Chock-a-Block 
Commanding the quarter-deck, — "Sir, twelve 

o'clock." 

Where sails he now, that trim sailing-master. 



[20] 



Slender, yes, as the ship's sky-s'l pole? 
Dimly I mind me of some sad disaster — 
Dainty Dave was dropped from the navy-roll! 
And ah, for old Lieutenant Chock-a-Block — 
Fast, wife, chock-fast to death's black dock! 
Buffeted about the obstreperous ocean, 
Fleeted his life, if lagged his promotion. 
Little girl, they are all, all gone, I think. 
Leaving Bridegroom Dick here with lids that 
wink. 

Where is Ap Catesby? The fights fought of 

yore 
Famed him, and laced him with epaulets, and 

more. 
But fame is a wake that after- wakes cross, 
And the waters wallow all, and laugh 

Where's the loss? 
But John Bull's bullet in his shoulder bearing 
Ballasted Ap in his long sea-faring. 
The middies they ducked to the man who had 

messed 
With Decatur in the gun-room, or forward 

pressed 
Fighting beside Perry, Hull, Porter, and the 

rest. 



[21] 



Humped veteran o' the Heart-o'-Oak war, 
JNIoored long in haven where the old heroes are, 
Never on yon did the iron-clads jar! 
Your open deck when the boarder assailed, 
The frank old heroic hand-to-hand then availed. 

But where's Guert Gan? Still heads he the van? 
As before Vera-Cruz, when he dashed splashing 

through 
The blue rollers sunned, in his brave gold-and- 

blue, 
And, ere his cutter in keel took the strand. 
Aloft waved his sword on the hostile land ! 
Went up the cheering, the quick chanticleering ; 
All hands vjang — all colors flying : 
"Cock-a-doodle-doo!" and "Row, boys, row!" 
"Hey, Starry Banner!" "Hi, Santa Anna!" 
Old Scott's young dash at Mexico. 

Fine forces o' the land, fine forces o' the sea. 
Fleet, army, and flotilla — tell, heart o' me, 
Tell, if you can, whereaway now they be ! 

But ah, how to speak of the hurricane 

unchained — 
The Union's strands parted in the hawser 

over-strained ; 

[22] 



Our flag blown to shreds, anchors gone 

altogether — 
The dashed fleet o' States in Secession's foul 

weather. 

Lost in the smother o' that wide public stress, 
In hearts, private hearts, what ties there were 

snapped! 
Tell, Hal — vouch, Will, o' the ward-room mess. 
On you how the riving thunder-bolt clapped. 
With a bead in your eye and beads in your glass, 
And a grip o' the flipper, it was part and pass : 
"Hal, must it be : Well, if come indeed the 

shock. 
To North or to South, let the victory cleave. 
Vaunt it he may on his dung-hill the cock. 
But Uncle Sam's eagle never crow will, 

believe." 

Sentiment: ay, while suspended hung all. 
Ere the guns against Sumter opened there 

the ball. 
And partners were taken, and the red dance 

began, 
War's red dance o' death ! — Well, we, to a man. 



[23] 



We sailors o' the North, wife, how could we 

lag?— 
Strike with your kin, and you stick to the flag! 
But to sailors o' tlie Soutli that easy way was 

barred. 
To some, dame, believe (and I speak o' what I 

know). 
Wormwood the trial and the Uzzite's black 

shard ; 
And the faithfuller the heart, the crueller the 

throe. 
Duty? It pulled with more than one string. 
This waj^ and that, and anyhow a sting. 
The flag and your kin, how be true unto both ? 
If either plight ye keep, then ye break the other 

troth. 
But elect here they must, though the casuists 

were out ; 
Decide — hurry up — and throttle every doubt. 

Of all these thrills thrilled at keelson, and 

throes. 
Little felt the shoddyites a-toasting o' their 

toes ; 
In mart and bazar Lucre chuckled the huzza, 
Coining the dollars in the bloody mint of war. 



[24] 



But in men, gray knights o' the Order o' Scars, 
And brave boys bound by vows unto Mars, 
Nature grappled honor, intertwisting in the 

strife : — 
But some cut the knot with a thoroughgoing 

knife. 
For how when the drums beat? How in the fray 
In Hampton Roads on the fine balmy day? 

There a lull, wife, befell — drop o' silent in the 

din. 
Let us enter that silence ere the belchings 

re-begin. 
Through a ragged rift aslant in the cannonade's 

smoke 
An iron-clad reveals her repellent broadside 
Bodily intact. But a frigate, all oak. 
Shows honeycombed by shot, and her deck 

crimson-dyed. 
And a trumpet from port of the iron-clad hails, 
Summoning the other, whose flag never trails : 
"Surrender that frigate. Will! Surrender, 
Or I will sink her — 7'am, and end her!" 

'T was Hal, And Will, from the naked heart- 
o'-oak, 



[25] 



Will, the old messmate, minus trumpet, spoke. 
Informally intrepid, — "Sink her, and be 

damned!"* 
Enough. Gathering way, the iron-clad ramvied. 
The frigate, heeling over, on the wave threw a 

dusk. 
Not sharing in the slant, the clapper of her bell 
The fixed metal struck — uinvoked struck the 

knell 
Of the Cumberland stillettoed by the 

Merrimac's tusk ; 
While, broken in the wound underneath the 

gun-deck. 
Like a sword-fish's blade in leviathan waylaid, 
The tusk was left infixed in the fast-foundering 

wreck. 
There, dungeoned in the cockpit, the wounded 

go down. 
And the chaplain with them. But the surges 

uplift 
The prone dead from deck, and for moment 

they drift 
Washed with the swimmers, and the spent 

swimmers drown. 

* Historic. 



[26] 



Nine fathom did she sink, — erect, though hid 

from hght 
Save her colors unsurrendered and spars that 

kept the height. 

Nay, pardon, old aunty ! Wife, never let it fall, 
That big started tear that hovers on the brim ; 
I forgot about your nephew and the Merrimac's 

ball; 
No more then of her, since it summons up him. 
But talk o' fellows' hearts in the wine's genial 

cup: — 
Trap them in the fate, jam them in the strait, 
Guns speak their hearts then, and speak 

right up. 
The troublous colic o' intestine war 
It sets the bowels o' affection ajar. 
But, lord, old dame, so spins the whizzing world, 
A humming-top, ay, for the little boy-gods 
Flogging it well with their smart little rods, 
Tittering at time and the coil uncurled. 

Now, now, sweetheart, you sidle away, 
No, never you like that kind o' gay; 
But sour if I get, giving truth her due. 
Honey-sweet forever, wife, will Dick be to you! 



[27] 



But avast with the War! Why recall racking 

days 
Since set up anew are the ship's started stays? 
Nor less, though the gale we have left behind, 
Well may the heave o' the sea remind. 
It irks me now, as it troubled me then, 
To think o' the fate in the madness o' men. 
If Dick was with Farragut on the night-river, 
When the boom-chain we burst in the fire-raft's 

glare, 
That blood-dyed the visage as red as the liver ; 
In the Battle for the Bay too if Dick had a 

share, 
And saw one aloft a-piloting the war — 
Trumpet in the whirlwind, a Providence in 

place — 
Our Admiral old whom the captains huzza, 
Dick joys in the man nor brags about the race. 

But better, wife, I like to booze on the days 
Ere the Old Order foundered in these very 

frays. 
And tradition was lost and we learned strange 

ways. 
Often I think on the brave cruises then ; 



[28] 



Re-sailing them in memory, I hail the press o' 

men 
On the gunned promenade where rolling they 

go, 
Ere the dog-watch expire and break up the 

show. 
The Laced Caps I see between forward guns ; 
Away from the powder-room they puff the 

cigar ; 
"Three days more, hey, the donnas and the 

dons!" 
"Your Zeres widow, will you hunt her up, 

Starr?" 
The Laced Caps laugh, and the bright waves 

too; 
Very jolly, very wicked, both sea and crew, 
Nor heaven looks sour on either, I guess, 
Nor Pecksniff he bosses the gods' high mess. 
Wistful ye peer, wife, concerned for my head. 
And how best to get me betimes to my bed. 

But king o' the club, the gayest golden spark, 
Sailor o' sailors, what sailor do I mark? 
Tom Tight, Tom Tight, no fine fellow finer, 
A cutwater nose, ay, a spirited soul ; 
But, bowsing away at the well-brewed bowl, 



[29] 



He never bowled back from that last voj^age to 
China. 

Tom was lieutenant in the brig-o'-war famed 
When an officer was hung for an arch-mutineer, 
But a mystery cleaved, and the captain was 

blamed. 
And a rumpus too raised, though his honor 

it was clear. 
And Tom he would say, when the mousers 

would try him, 
And with cup after cup o' Burgundy ply him: 
"Gentlemen, in vain with your wassail you 

beset. 
For the more I tipple, the tighter do I get." 
No blabber, no, not even with the can — 
True to himself and loyal to his clan. 

Tom blessed us starboard and d — d us larboard. 
Right down from rail to the streak o' the 

garboard. 
ISTor less, wife, we liked him. — Tom was a man 
In contrast queer with Chaplain Le Fan, 
Who blessed us at morn, and at night yet again, 
D — ning us only in decorous strain ; 



[30] 



Preaching 'tween the guns — each cutlass in its 

place — 
From text that averred old Adam a hard case. 
I see him — Tom — on horse-hloch standing, 
Trumpet at mouth, thrown up all amain. 
An elephant's bugle, vociferous demanding 
Of topmen aloft in the hurricane of rain, 
"Letting that sail there your faces flog? 
Manhandle it, men, and you'll get the good 

grog!" 
O Tom, but he knew a blue- jacket's ways, 
And how a lieutenant may genially haze ; 
Only a sailor sailors heartily praise. 

Wife, where be all these chaps, I wonder? 
Trumpets in the tempest, terrors in the fray. 
Boomed their commands along the deck like 

thunder ; 
But silent is the sod, and thunder dies away. 
But Captain Turret, ''Old Hemlock'' tall, 
(A leaning tower when his tank brimmed all,) 
Manoeuvre out alive from the war did he ? 
Or, too old for that, drift under the lee ? 
Kentuckian colossal, who, touching at Madeira, 
The huge puncheon shipped o' prime 

Santa-Clara; 



[31] 



Then rocked along the deck so solemnly ! 

No whit the less though judicious was enough 

In dealing with the Finn who made the great 

hutf; 
Our three-decker's giant, a grand boatswain's 

mate, 
Manliest of men in his own natural senses ; 
But driven stark mad by the devil's drugged 

stuff. 
Storming all aboard from his run-ashore late. 
Challenging to battle, vouchsafing no pretenses, 
A reeling King Ogg, delirious in power, 
The quarter-deck carronades he seemed to 

make cower. 
"Put him in brig there!" said Lieutenant 

Marrot. 
"Put him in hiig!" back he mocked like a 

parrot ; 
"Try it, then ! " swaj^ing a fist like Thor's 

sledge. 
And making the pigmy constables hedge — 
Ship's corporals and the master-at-arms. 
"In brig there, I say!" — They dally no more; 
Like hounds let slip on a desperate boar. 
Together they pounce on the formidable Finn, 
Pinion and cripple and hustle him in. 



[32] 



Anon, under sentry, between twin guns, 

He slides off in drowse, and the long night runs. 

Morning brings a summons. Whistling it calls. 
Shrilled through the pipes of the boatswain's 

four aids ; 
Trilled down the hatchwaj^s along the dusk 

halls : 
Muster to the Scourge! — Dawn of doom and 

its blast ! 
As from cemeteries raised, sailors swarm before 

the mast, 
Tumbling up the ladders from the ship's nether 

shades. 

Keeping in the background and taking small 

part. 
Lounging at their ease, indifferent in face. 
Behold the trim marines uncompromised in 

heart ; 
Their Major, buttoned up, near the staff finds 

room — 
The staff o' lieutenants standing grouped in 

their place. 
All the Laced Caps o' the ward-room come. 



[33] 



The Chaplain among them, discipHned and 

dmiib. 
The bhie-nosed boatswain, complexioned hke 

slag, 
Like a blue Monday lours — liis implements in 

bag. 
Executioners, his aids, a couple by him stand, 
At a nod there the thongs to receive from his 

hand. 
Never venturing a caveat whatever may betide, 
Thou"-h functionally here on humanity's side, 
The grave Surgeon shows, like the formal 

physician 
Attending the rack o' the Spanish Inquisition. 

The angel o' the "brig" brings his prisoner up ; 
Then, steadied by his old Santa-Clara, a sup. 
Heading all erect, the ranged assizes there, 
Lo, Captain Turret, and under starred 

bunting, 
(A florid full face and fine silvered hair,) 
Gigantic the yet greater giant confronting. 

Now the culprit he liked, as a tall captain can 
A Titan subordinate and true sailor-man; 



[34] 



And frequent he'd shown it — no worded 

advance, 
But flattering the Finn with a well-timed 

glance. 
But what of that now? In the martinet-mien 
Read the Articles of War, heed the naval 

routine ; 
While, cut to the heart a dishonor there to win. 
Restored to his senses, stood the Anak Finn ; 
In racked self-control the squeezed tears 

peeping, 
Scalding the eye with repressed inkeeping. 
Discipline must be ; the scourge is deemed due. 
But ah for the sickening and strange heart- 

benumibing, 
Compassionate abasement in shipmates that 

view; 
Such a grand champion shamed there 

succumbing ! 
"Brown, tie him up." — The cord he brooked: 
How else ? — his arms spread apart — never 

threaping ; 
No, never he flinched, never sideways he looked, 
Peeled to the waistband, the marble flesh 

creeping. 
Lashed by the sleet the officious winds urge. 



[35] 



In function his fellows their fellowship merge — 
The twain standing nigh — the two boatswain's 

mates, 
Sailors of his grade, ay, and brothers of his 

mess. 
With sharp thongs adroop the junior one 

awaits 
The word to uplift. 

"Untie him — so! 
Submission is enough, Man, you may go." 
Then, promenading aft, brushing fat Purser 

Smart, 
"Flog? Never meant it — hadn't any heart. 
Degrade that tall fellow?" — Such, wife, was he, 
Old Captain Turret, who the brave wine could 

stow. 
Magnanimous, you think? — But what does 

Dick see? 
Apron to your eye ! Why, never fell a blow ; 
Cheer up, old wifie, 't was a long time ago. 

But where's that sore one, crabbed and severe. 
Lieutenant Lon Lumbago, an arch scrutineer? 
Call the roll to-day, would he answer — Here! 
When the Blixum's fellows to quarters 
mustered 



[36] 



How he'd lurch along the lane of gun-crews 

clustered, 
Testy as touchwood, to pry and to peer. 
Jerking his sword underneath larhoard arm, 
He ground his worn grinders to keep himself 

calm. 
Composed in his nerves, from the fidgets set 

free. 
Tell, Sweet Wrinkles, alive now is he, 
In Paradise a parlor where the even 

tempers he ? 

Where's Commander All-a-Tanto ? 
Where's Orlop Bob singing up from below? 
Where's Rhyming Ned? has he spun his last 

canto ? 
Where's Jewsharp Jim? Where's Ringadoon 

Joe? 
Ah, for the music over and done, 
The band all dismissed save the droned 

trombone I 
Where's Glenn o' the gun-room, who loved 

Hot- Scotch — 
Glen, prompt and cool in a perilous watch ? 
Where's flaxen-haired Phil? a gray lieutenant? 
Or rubicund, flying a dignified pennant? 



[37] 



But where sleeps his brother?- — the cruise it was 

o'er, 
But ah, for death's grip that welcomed him 

ashore ! 
Where's Sid, the cadet, so frank in his brag, 
Whose toast was audacious — "Here's Sid, and 

Sid's flag!" 
Like holiday-craft that have sunk unkno\Mi, 
May a lark of a lad go lonely down? 
Who takes the census under the sea ? 
Can others like old ensigns be, 
Bunting I hoisted to flutter at the gaff — 
Rags in end that once were flags 
Gallant streaming from the staff ? 

Such scurvy doom could the chances deal 
To Top-Gallant Harry and Jack Genteel? 
Lo, Genteel Jack in hurricane weather. 
Shagged like a bear, like a red lion roaring ; 
But O, so fine in his chapeau and feather, 
In port to the ladies never once jawing; 
All bland politesse, how urbane was he — 
''Oui, mademoiselle" — "Ma chere amie!" 

'T was Jack got up the ball at Naples, 
Gay in the old Ohio glorious ; 



[38] 



His hair was curled by the berth-deck barber, 
Never you'd deemed him a cub of rude Boreas ; 
In tight httle pumps, with the grand dames in 

rout, 
A-flinging his shapely foot all about ; 
His watch-chain with love's jeweled tokens 

abounding. 
Curls ambrosial shaking out odors. 
Waltzing along the batteries, astounding 
The gunner glum and the grim-visaged loaders. 

Wife, where be all these blades, I wonder, 
Pennoned fine fellows, so strong, so gay? 
Never their colors with a dip dived under ; 
Have they hauled them down in a lack-lustre 

day, 
Or beached their boats in the Far, Far Away? 
Hither and thither, blown wide asunder, 
Where's this fleet, I wonder and wonder. 
Slipt their cables, rattled their adieu, 
(Whereaway pointing? to what rendezvous?) 
Out of sight, out of mind, like the crack 

Constitution, 
And many a keel time never shall renew — 
Bon Homme Dick o' the buff Revolution, 
The Black Cockade and the staunch True-Blue. 



[39] 



Doff hats to Decatur! But where is his blazon? 
Must merited fame endure time's wrong — 
Gloiy's ripe grape wizen up to a raisin? 
Yes ! for Nature teems, and the years are 

strong, 
And who can keep the tally o' the names that 

fleet along! 

But his frigate, wife, his bride ? Would 

blacksmiths brown 
Into smithereens smite the solid old renown ? 
Rivetting the bolts in the iron-clad's shell, 
Hark to the hammers with a rat-tat-tat; 
"Handier a derby than a laced cocked hat! 
The Monitor was ugl}^ but she served us right 

well, 
Better than the Cumberland, a beauty and the 

belle." 

Better than the Cumherland! — Heart alive 

in me! 
That battlemented hull, Tantallon o' the sea, 
Kicked in, as at Boston the taxed chests o' tea! 
Ay, spurned by the ram, once a tall, shapely 

craft. 



[40] 



But lopped by the Rebs to an iron-beaked 

raft — 
A blacksmith's unicorn in armor cap-a-pie. 

Under the water-line a rarns blow is dealt : 
And foul fall the knuckles that strike below the 

belt. 
Nor brave the inventions that serve to replace 
The openness of valor while dismantling the 

grace. 

Aloof from all this and the never-ending game, 
Tantamount to teetering, plot and counterplot ; 
Impenetrable armor — all-perforating shot ; 
Aloof, bless God, ride the war-ships of old, 
A grand fleet moored in the roadstead of fame ; 
Not submarine sneaks with them are enrolled ; 
Their long shadows dwarf us, their flags are as 
flame. 

Don't fidget so, wife ; an old man's passion 
Amounts to no more than this smoke that I 

puff; 
There, there, now, buss me in good old fashion ; 
A died-down candle will flicker in the snuff. 



[«] 



But one last thing let your old babbler say, 

What Decatur's coxswain said who was long 
ago hearsed, 

"Take in your flying-kites, for there comes a 
lubber's day 

When gallant things will go, and the three- 
deckers first." 

My pipe is smoked out, and the grog runs 

slack ; 
But bowse away, wife, at your blessed Bohea; 
This empty can here must needs solace me — 
Nay, sweetheart, nay ; I take that back ; 
Dick drinks from your eyes and he finds no 

lack! 



[42] 



TOM DEADLIGHT 

During a tempest encountered homeward-hound from 
the Mediterranean, a grizzled petty-officer, one of the 
two captains of the forecastle, dying at night in his ham- 
mock, swung in the sick-bay under the tiered gun-decks 
of the British Dreadnaught, 98, wandering in his mind, 
though with glimpses of sanity, and starting up at whiles, 
sings by snatches his good-bye and last injunctions to 
two messmates, his watchers, one of whom fans the 
fevered tar with the flap of his old sou'wester. Some 
names and phrases, with here and there a line, or part of 
one; these, in his aberration, wrested into incoherency 
from their original connection and import, he voluntarily 
derives, as he does the measure, from a famous old sea- 
ditty, whose cadences, long rife, and now humming in the 
collapsing brain, attune the last flutterings of distem- 
pered thought. 

Faeewell and adieu to you noble hearties, — 
Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Sj)ain, 
For I've received orders for to sail for the 
Deadman, 
But hope with the grand fleet to see you 
again. 



[43] 



I have hove my ship to, with main-top-sail 
aback, boys ; 
I have hove my ship to, for the strike 
soundings clear — 
The black scud a'flying; but, by God's blessing, 
dam' me. 
Right up the Channel for the Deadman I'll 
steer. 

I have worried through the waters that are 
called the Doldrums, 
And growled at Sargasso that clogs while ye 
grope — 
Blast my eyes, but the light-ship is hid by the 
mist, lads : — 
Flying Dutclwian — odds bobbs — off the 
Cape of Good Hope ! 

But what's this I feel that is fanning my cheek, 
Matt? 
The white goney's wing? — how she rolls! — 
't is the Cape ! — 
Give my kit to the mess, Jock, for kin none is 
mine, none ; 
And tell Holy Joe to avast with the crape. 



[44] 



Dead reckoning, says Joe, it won't do to go by ; 
But they doused all the glims, Matt, in sky 
t' other night. 
Dead reckoning is good for to sail for the 
Deadman; 
And Tom Deadlight he thinks it may reckon 
near right. 

The signal ! — it streams for the grand fleet to 
anchor. 
The captains — the trumpets — the hullabaloo ! 
Stand by for blue-blazes, and mind your 
shank-painters. 
For the Lord High Admiral, he's squinting 
at you! 

But give me my tot. Matt, before I roll over; 
Jock, let's have your flipper, it's good for to 
feel; 
And don't sew me up without haccy in mouth, 
boys, 
And don't blubber like lubbers when I turn 
up my keel. 



[45] 



JACK HOY 

Kept up by relays of generations young 
Never dies at halyards the blithe chorus sung ; 
While in sands, sounds, and seas where the 

storm-petrels cry. 
Dropped mute around the globe, these halyard 

singers lie. 
Short-lived the clippers for racing-cups that 

run, 
And speeds in life's career many a lavish 

mother's-son. 

But thou, manly king o' the old Splendid' s 

crew. 
The ribbons o' thy hat still a-fluttering, should 

fly- 

A challenge, and forever, nor the braveiy 

should rue. 
Only in a tussle for the stariy flag high, 
AVlien 'tis piety to do, and privilege to die. 
Then, only then, would heaven think to lop 
Such a cedar as the captain o' the Splendid' s 

main- top : 
A belted sea-gentleman ; a gallant, off-hand 
Mercutio indifferent in life's gay command. 
Magnanimous in humor ; when the splintering 

shot fell, 

[46] 



"Tooth-picks a-plenty, lads; thank 'em with a 
shell!" 

Sang Larry o' the Cannakin, smuggler o' the 

wine, 
At mess between guns, lad in jovial recline: 
"In Limbo our Jack he would chirrup up a 

cheer, 
The martinet there find a chaffing mutineer ; 
From a thousand fathoms down under hatches 

o' your Hades, 
He'd ascend in love-ditty, kissing fingers to 

your ladies!" 

Never relishing the knave, though allowing 

for the menial. 
Nor overmuch the king, Jack, nor prodigally 

genial. 
Ashore on hberty he flashed in escapade, 
Vaulting over life in its levelness of grade. 
Like the dolphin off Africa in rainbow 

a-sweeping — 
Arch iridescent shot from seas languid 

sleeping. 

Larking with thy life, if a joy but a toy. 
Heroic in thy levity wert thou. Jack Roy. 



[47] 



SEA PIECES 



THE HAGLETS 

By chapel bare, with walls sea-beat 
The lichened urns in wilds are lost 
About a carved memorial stone 
That shows, decayed and coral-mossed, 
A f oi-m recumbent, swords at feet, 
Trophies at head, and kelp for a 
winding-sheet. 

I invoke thy ghost, neglected fane. 
Washed by the waters' long lament; 
I adjure the recumbent effigy 
To tell the cenotaph's intent — 
Reveal why f agotted swords are at feet. 
Why trophies appear and weeds are the 
winding-sheet. 

By open ports the Admiral sits. 
And shares repose with guns that tell 
Of power that smote the arm'd Plate Fleet 
Whose sinking flag-ship's colors fell; 
But over the Admiral floats in light 
His squadron's flag, the red-cross Flag 
of the White. 



[51] 



The eddying waters whirl astern, 
The prow, a seedsman, sows the spray ; 
With bellying sails and buckling spars 
The black hull leaves a Milky Way ; 
Her timbers thrill, her batteries roll. 
She revelling speeds exulting with pennon 
at pole, 

But ah, for standards captive trailed 
For all their scutcheoned castles' pride — 
Castilian towers that dominate Spain, 
Naples, and either Ind beside ; 
Those haughty towers, armorial ones, 
Rue the salute from the Admiral's dens 
of guns. 

Ensigns and arms in trophy brave. 
Braver for many a rent and scar. 
The captor's naval hall bedeck. 
Spoil that insures an earldom's star — 
Toledoes great, grand draperies, too, 
Spain's steel and silk, and splendors from 
Peru. 

But crippled part in splintering fight. 
The vanquished flying the victor's flags. 



[52] 



With prize-crews, under convoy-guns, 
Heavy the fleet from Opher drags — 
The Admiral crowding sail ahead, 
Foremost with news who foremost in conflict 
sped. 

But out from cloistral gallery dim, 
In early night his glance is thrown; 
He marks the vague reserve of heaven. 
He feels the touch of ocean lone ; 
Then turns, in frame part undermined, 
Nor notes the shadowing wings that fan 
behind. 

There, peaked and gray, three haglets fly, 

And follow, follow fast in wake 

Where slides the cabin-lustre shy. 

And sharks from man a glamour take. 

Seething along the line of light 

In lane that endless rules the war-ship's flight. 

The sea- fowl here, whose hearts none know. 
They followed late the flag-ship quelled, 
(Asnowthe victor one) and long 
Above her gurgling grave, shrill held 



[53] 



With screams their wheehng rites — then sped 
Direct in silence where the victor led. 

Now winds less fleet, hut fairer, blow, 
A ripple laps the coppered side, 
While phosphor sparks make ocean gleam, 
Like camps lit up in triumph wide ; 
With lights and tinkling cymbals meet 
Acclaiming seas the advancing conqueror 
greet. 

But who a flattering tide may trust, 
Or favoring breeze, or aught in end? — 
Careening under startling blasts 
The sheeted towers of sails impend ; 
While, gathering bale, behind is bred 
A livid storm-bow, like a rainbow dead. 

At trumpet-call the topmen spring ; 
And, urged by after-call in stress, 
Yet other tribes of tars ascend 
The rigging's howling wilderness ; 
But ere yard-ends alert they win. 
Hell rules in heaven with hurricane-fire 
and din. 



[54] 



The spars, athwart at sj^iry height, 
Like quaking Lima's crosses rock; 
Like bees the clustering sailors cling 
Against the shrouds, or take the shock 
Flat on the swept yard-arms aslant, 
Dipped like the wheeling condor's pinions 
gaunt. 

A LULL ! and tongues of languid flame 
Lick every boom, and lambent show 
Electric 'gainst each face aloft ; 
The herds of clouds with bellowings go : 
The black ship rears — beset — harassed, 
Then plunges far with luminous antlers vast. 

In trim betimes they turn from land. 
Some shivered sails and spars they stow ; 
One watch, dismissed, they troll the can. 
While loud the billow thumps the bow — 
Vies with the fist that smites the board, 
Obstreperous at each reveller's jovial word. 

Of royal oak by storms confirmed, 
The tested hull her lineage shows : 
Vainly the plungings whelm her prow — 
She rallies, rears, she sturdier grows : 



[55] 



Ecach shot-hole jjlugged, each storm-sail home, 
With batteries housed she rams the watery 
dome. 

Dim seen adrift through driving scud, 
The wan moon shows in plight forlorn ; 
Then, pinched in visage, fades and fades 
Like to the faces drowned at morn, 
When deeps engulfed the flag-ship's crew, 
And, shrilling round, the inscrutable haglets 
flew. 

And still they fly, nor now they cry, 

But constant fan a second wake. 

Unflagging pinions ply and plj^ 

Abreast their course intent they take ; 

Their silence marks a stable mood, 

They patient keep their eager neighborhood. 

Plumed with a smoke, a confluent sea, 
Heaved in a combing pyramid full, 
Spent at its climax, in collapse 
Down headlong thundering stuns the hull : 
The trophy drops; but, reared again. 
Shows Mars' high-altar and contemns the 
main. 



[56] 



Rebuilt it stands, the brag of arms, 
Transferred in site — no thought of where 
The sensitive needle keeps its place, 
And starts, disturbed, a quiverer there ; 
The helmsman rubs the clouded glass — 
Peers in, but lets the trembling portent pass. 

Let pass as well his shipmates do 
(Whose dream of power no tremors jar) 
Fears for the fleet convoyed astern : 
"Our flag they fly, they share our star ; 
Spain's galleons great in hull are stout : 
Manned by our men — like us they'll ride it 
out." 

Tonight's the night that ends the week — 
Ends day and week and month and year : 
A fourfold imminent flickering time, 
For now the midnight draws anear : 
Eight bells ! and passing-bells they be — 
The Old year fades, the Old Year dies at sea. 

He launched them well. But shall the New 
Redeem the pledge the Old Year made. 
Or prove a self -asserting heir? 
But healthy hearts few qualms invade : 



[57] 



By shot-chests grouped in bays 'tween giins 
The gossips chat, the grizzled, sea-beat ones. 

And boyish dreams some graybeards blab : 
"To sea, my lads, we go no more 
Who share the Acapulco prize ; 
We'll all night in, and bang the door; 
Our ingots red shall yield us bliss : 
Lads, golden years begin to-night with this!" 



Released from deck, yet waiting call, 
Glazed caps and coats baptized in storm, 
A watch of Laced Sleeves round the board 
Draw near in heart to keep them warm : 
"Sweethearts and wives!" clink, clink, they 

meet, 
And, quaffing, dip in wine their beards of 

sleet. 
"Ay, let the star-light stay withdrawn. 
So here her hearth-light memory fling. 
So in this wine-light cheer be born. 
And honor's fellowship weld our ring — 
Honor ! our Admiral's aim foretold : 



A tomh or a trophy, and lo, 't is a trophy and 
gold!" 
But he, a unit, sole in rank, 

[58] 



Apart needs keep Ms lonely state, 

The sentiy at his guarded door 

Mute as by vault the sculptured Fate ; 

Belted he sits in drowsy light, 

And, hatted, nods — the Admiral of the White. 

He dozes, aged with watches passed — 
Years, years of pacing to and fro ; 
He dozes, nor attends the stir 
In bullioned standards rustling low. 
Nor minds the blades whose secret thrill 
Perverts overhead the magnet's Polar will : — 

Less heeds the shadowing three that play 
And follow, follow fast in wake, 
Untiring wing and lidless eye — 
Abreast their course intent they take ; 
Or sigh or sing, they hold for good 
The unvarying flight and fixed inveterate 
mood. 

In dream at last his dozings merge. 
In dream he reaps his victor's fruit ; 
The Flags-o'-the-Blue, the Flags-o'-the-Red, 
Dipped flags of his country's fleets salute 
His Flag-o '-the- White in harbor proud — 



[59] 



But why should it blench? Why turn to a 
painted shroud? 

The hungry seas they hound the hull, 
The sharks they dog the haglets' flight ; 
With one consent the winds, the waves 
In hunt with fins and wings unite, 
While drear the harps in cordage sound 
Remindful wails for old Armadas drowned. 

Ha — yonder ! are they Northern Lights ? 
Or signals flashed to warn or ward? 
Yea, signals lanced in breakers high ; 
But doom on warning follows hard: 
While yet they veer in hope to shun. 
They strike ! and thumps of hull and heart are 
one. 

But beating hearts a diomi-beat calls 
And prompt the men to quarters go ; 
Discipline, curbing nature, rules — 
Heroic makes who duty know : 
They execute the trump's command, 
Or in peremptory places wait and stand. 

Yet cast about in blind amaze — 
As through their watery shroud they peer : 

[60] 



"We tacked from land: then how betrayed? 
Have currents swerved us — snared us here?" 
None heed the blades that clash m place 
Under lamps dashed down that lit the 
magnet's case. 

Ah, what may live, who mighty swim, 
Or boat-crew reach that shore forbid, 
Or cable span? JMust victors drown — 
Perish, even as the vanquished did? 
Man keeps from man the stifled moan ; 
They shouldering stand, yet each in heart 
how lone. 

Some heaven invoke ; but rings of reefs 
Prayer and despair ahke deride 
In dance of breakers forked or peaked. 
Pale maniacs of the maddened tide ; 
While, strenuous yet some end to earn. 
The haglets spin, though now no more astern. 

Like shuttles hurrying in the looms 
Aloft through rigging frayed they ply — 
Cross and recross — weave and inweave. 
Then lock the web with clinching cry 
Over the seas on seas that clasp 



[61] 



The weltering wreck where gurghng ends the 
gasp. 

Ah, for the Plate-Fleet trophy now, 
The victor's voucher, flags and arms ; 
Never they'll hang in Abbey old 
And take Time's dust with holier palms ; 
Nor less content, in liquid night, 
Their captor sleeps — the Admiral of the 
White. 

Imbedded deep with shells 

And drifted treasure deep. 

Forever he sinks deeper in 

Unfathomable sleep — 

His cannon round him thrown. 

His sailors at his feet. 

The wizard sea enchanting them 

Where never haglets beat. 

On nights when meteors play 
And hght the breakers dance. 
The Oreads from the caves 
With silverj'^ elves advance ; 
And up from ocean stream. 
And down from heaven far. 
The rays that blend in dream 
The abysm and the star. 

[62] 



THE AEOLIAN HARP 

At The Surf Inn 

List the harp in window wailing 
Stirred by fitful gales from sea : 

Shi'ieking up in mad crescendo — 
Dying down in plaintive key 1 

Listen : less a strain ideal 

Than Ai'iel's rendering of the Real. 

What that Real is, let hint 

A picture stamped in memory's mint. 

Braced well up, with beams aslant, 
Betwixt the continents sails the Phocion, 
For Baltimore bound from Alicant. 
Blue breezy skies wliite fleeces fleck 
Over the chill blue white-capped ocean : 
From yard-arm comes — "Wreck ho, a 
wreck!" 

Dismasted and adrift. 
Longtime a thing forsaken ; 
Ovei-washed by eveiy wave 
Like the slumbering kraken ; 
Heedless if the billow roar. 
Oblivious of the lull, 

[68] 



Leagues and leagues from shoal or shore, 
It swims — a levelled hull : 
Bulwarks gone — a shaven wreck, 
Nameless and a grass-green deck. 
A lumberman : perchance, in hold 
Prostrate pines with hemlocks rolled. 

It has drifted, waterlogged. 
Till by trailing weeds beclogged : 

Drifted, drifted, day by day, 

Pilotless on pathless way. 
It has drifted till each plank 
Is oozy as the oyster-bank : 

Drifted, drifted, night by night, 

Craft that never shows a light ; 
Nor ever, to prevent worse knell, 
Tolls in fog the warning bell. 

From collision never shrinking. 

Drive what may through darksome smother; 

Saturate, but never sinking, " 

Fatal only to the other! 

Deadlier than the sunken reef 
Since still the snare it shifteth. 

Torpid in dumb ambuscade 
Waylayingly it drif teth. 



[64] 



O, the sailors — O, the sails ! 

O, the lost crews never heard of ! 

Well the harp of Ariel wails 

Thought that tongue can tell no word of ! 



[65] 



TO THE MASTER OF 
THE METEOR 

Lonesome on earth's loneliest deep, 
Sailor! who dost thy vigil keep — 
Off the Cape of Storms dost musing sweep 
Over monstrous waves that curl and comb ; 
Of thee we think when here from brink 
We blow the mead in bubbling foam. 

Of thee we think, in a ring we link; 

To the shearer of ocean's fleece we drink. 

And the Meteor rolling home. 



[66] 



FAR OFF-SHORE 

LooKj the raft, a signal flying, 

Thin — a shred ; 
None upon the lashed spars lying, 

Quick or dead. 

Cries the sea-fowl, hovering over, 

"Crew, the crew?" 
And the billow, reckless, rover. 

Sweeps anew! 



[67] 



THE MAN-OF-WAR HAWK 

Yon black man-of-war-hawk that wheels in 

the light 
O'er the black ship's white sky-s'l, sunned 

cloud to the sight, 
Have we low-flyers wings to ascend to his 

height ? 
No arrow can reach him ; nor thought can 

attain 
To the placid supreme in the sweep of his 

reign. 



[68] 



THE FIGURE-HEAD 

The Charles- and- Emma seaward sped, 
(Named from the carven pair at prow,) 
He so smart, and a curly head. 
She tricked forth as a bride knows how : 
Pretty stem for the port, I trow ! 

But iron-rust and alum-spray 
And chafing gear, and sun and dew 
Vexed this lad and lassie gay. 
Tears in their eyes, salt tears nor few ; 

And the hug relaxed with the faihng glue. 

But came in end a dismal night. 
With creaking beams and ribs that groan, 
A black lee-shore and waters white : 
Dropped on the reef, the pair lie prone : 
O, the breakers dance, but the winds they 
moan I 



[69] 



THE GOOD CRAFT 
SNOW BIRD 

Strenuous need that head-wind be 

From purposed voyage that drives at last 

The ship, sharp-braced and dogged still, 
Beating up against the blast. 

Brigs that figs for market gather. 
Homeward-bound upon the stretch. 

Encounter oft this uglier weather 
Yet in end their port they fetch. 

Mark yon craft from sunny Smyrna 
Glazed with ice in Boston Bay; 

Out they toss the fig-drums cheerly, 
Livelier for the frosty ray. 

What if sleet off-shore assailed her. 
What though ice yet plate her yards ; 

In wintiy port not less she renders 
Summer's gift with warm regards ! 

And, look, the underwriters' man. 
Timely, when the stevedore's done. 

Puts on his specs to pry and scan. 
And sets her down — A, Mo. 1. 

[70] 



Bravo, master! Bravo, brig! 

For slanting snows out of the West 
Never the Snow-Bird cares one fig ; 

And foul winds steady her, though a pest. 



[71] 



OLD COUNSEL 

Of The Young vM aster of a Wrecked 
California Clipper 

Come out of the Golden Gate, 
Go round the Horn with streamers, 

Carry royals early and late ; 

But, brother, be not over-elate — 

All hands save ship! has startled dreamers. 



[72] 



THE TUFT OF KELP 

All dripping in tangles green, 
Cast up by a lonely sea 

If purer for that, O Weed, 
Bitterer, too, are ye ? 



[73] 



THE MALDIVE SHARK 

About the Shark, phlegmatical one, 

Pale sot of the Maldive sea. 

The sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim. 

How alert in attendance be. 

From his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel 

of maw 
They have nothing of harm to dread. 
But liquidly glide on his ghastly flank 
Or before his Gorgonian head : 
Or lurk in the port of serrated teeth 
In white triple tiers of glittering gates. 
And there find a haven when peril's abroad. 
An asylum in jaws of the Fates ! 
They are friends ; and friendly they guide him 

to prey, 
Yet never partake of the treat — 
EjT^es and brains to the dotard lethargic and 

dull, 
Pale ravener of horrible meat. 



[74] 



TO NED 

Where is the world we roved, Ned Bunn? 

Hollows thereof lay rich in shade 
By voyagers old inviolate thrown 

Ere Paul Pry cruised with Pelf and Trade. 
To us old lads some thoughts come home 
Who roamed a world young lads no more shall 
roam. 

Nor less the satiate year impends 
When, wearying of routine-resorts. 

The pleasure-hunter shall break loose, 
Ned, for our Pantheistic ports : — 

JMarquesas and glenned isles that be 

Authentic Edens in a Pagan sea. 

The charm of scenes untried shall lure. 
And, Ned, a legend urge the flight — 

The Typee-truants under stars 

Unknown to Shakespere's Midsummer- 
JVight; 

And man, if lost to Saturn's Age, 
et feeling life no Syrian pilgrimage. 



Y 



But, tell, shall he, the tourist, find 
Our isles the same in violet-glow 

[75] 



Enamoring us what years and years — 
Ah, Ned, what years and years ago ! 
Well, Adam advances, smart in pace. 
But scarce by violets that advance you trace. 

But we, in anchor-watches calm, 
The Indian Psyche's languor won. 

And, musing, breathed primeval balm 
From Edens ere yet overrun; 

Marvelling mild if mortal twice, 

Here and hereafter, touch a Paradise. 



[70] 



CROSSING THE TROPICS 

From "The Saya-y-Manto." 

While now the Pole Star sinks from sight 

The Southern Cross it climbs the sky; 
But losing thee, my love, my light, 

bride but for one bridal night, 
The loss no rising joys supply. 

Love, love, the Trade Winds urge abaft, 
And thee, from thee, the}^ steadfast waft. 

By day the blue and silver sea 

And chime of waters blandly fanned — 
Nor these, nor Gama's stars to me 
May yield delight since still for thee 

I long as Gama longed for land. 

1 yearn, I yearn, reverting turn, 
My heart it streams in wake astern 
When, cut by slanting sleet, we swoop 

Where raves the world's inverted year. 
If roses all your porch shall loop. 
Not less your heart for me will droop 

Doubling the world's last outpost drear. 

O love, O love, these oceans vast : 
Love, love, it is as death were past !

THE BERG 

A. Dream 

I SAW a ship of martial build 

(Her standards set, her brave apparel on) 

Directed as by madness mere 

Against a stolid iceberg steer, 

Nor budge it, though the infatuate ship went 

down. 
The impact made huge ice-cubes fall 
Sullen, in tons that crashed the deck ; 
But that one avalanche was all — 
No other movement save the foundering 

wreck. 

Along the spurs of ridges pale, 

Not any slenderest shaft and frail, 

A prism over glass — green gorges lone, 

Toppled ; nor lace of traceries fine. 

Nor pendant drops in grot or mine 

Were jarred, when the stunned ship went 

down. 
Nor sole the gulls in cloud that wheeled 
Circling one snow-flanked peak afar, 
But nearer fowl the floes that skimmed 
And crystal beaches, felt no jar. 
No thrill transmitted stirred the lock 



[78] 



Of jack-straw needle-ice at base ; 
Towers undermined by waves — the block 
Atilt impending — kept their place. 
Seals, dozing sleek on sliddery ledges 
Slipt never, when by loftier edges 
Through veiy inertia overthrown. 
The impetuous ship in bafflement went down. 
Hard Berg (methought) , so cold, so vast, 
With mortal damps self-overcast ; 
Exhaling still thy dankish breath — 
Adrift dissolving, bound for death; 
Though lumpish thou, a lumbering one — 
A lumbering lubbard loitering slow, 
Impingers rue thee and go down. 
Sounding thy precipice below, 
Nor stir the slimy slug that sprawls 
Along thy dense stolidity of walls. 



[79] 



THE ENVIABLE ISLES 

From " Rammon." 

Through storms you reach them and from 
stomis are free. 
Afar descried, the foremost drear in hue, 
But, nearer, green; and, on the marge, the sea 
Makes thunder low and mist of rainbowed 
dew. 

But, inland, where the sleep that folds the hills 
A dreamier sleep, the trance of God, instills — 

On uplands hazed, in wandering airs 
aswoon, 
Slow-swaying palms salute love's cypress tree 

Adown in vale where pebbly runlets croon 
A song to lull all sorrow and all glee. 

Sweet-fern and moss in many a glade are here. 
Where, strewn in flocks, what cheek-flushed 
myriads lie 
Dimpling in dream — unconscious slumberers 
mere. 
While billows endless round the beaches die. 



[80] 



PEBBLES 

I 

Though the Clerk of the Weather insist, 

And lay down the weather-law, 
Pintado and gannet they wist 
That the winds blow whither they list 
In tempest or flaw. 

II 

Old are the creeds, but stale the schools, 

Revamped as the mode may veer, 
But Orm from the schools to the beaches 

strays 
And, finding a Conch hoar with time, he 
delays 

And reverent lifts it to ear. 
That Voice, pitched in far monotone. 

Shall it swerve? shall it deviate ever? 
The Seas have inspired it, and Truth — 

Truth, varying from sameness never. 

Ill 

In hollows of the liquid hills 

Where the long Blue Ridges run. 

The flattery of no echo thrills, 
For echo the seas have none ; 

Nor aught that gives man back man's strain- 

The hope of his heart, the dream in his brain. 

[81] 



IV 

On ocean where the embattled fleets repair, 
Man, suffering inflictor, sails on sufferance 
there. 

V 
Implacable I, the old Implacable Sea: 

Implacable most when most I smile serene — 
Pleased, not appeased, by myriad wrecks in 
me. 

VI 
Curled in the comb of yon billow Andean, 

Is it the Dragon's heaven-challenging crest? 
Elemental mad ramping of ravening waters — 
Yet Christ on the Mount, and the dove in 
her nest ! 

VII 
Healed of my hurt, I laud the inhuman Sea — 
Yea, bless the Angels Four that there convene ; 
For healed I am ever by their pitiless breath 
Distilled in wholesome dew named rosmarine.

POEMS FROM 
TIMOLEON 



LINES TRACED UNDER AN 

IMAGE OF AMOR 

THREATENING 

Fear me, virgin whosoever 
Taking pride from love exempt, 

Fear me, slighted. Never, never 
Brave me, nor my fury tempt : 
Downy wings, but wroth they beat 
Tempest even in reason's seat. 



[85] 



THE NIGHT MARCH 

With banners furled and clarions mute, 
An army passes in the night ; 

And beaming spears and helms salute 
The dark with bright. 

In silence deep the legions stream, 
With open ranks, in order true ; 

Over boundless plains they stream and 
gleam — 
No chief in view ! 



Afar, in twinkling distance lost, 



( So legends tell) he lonely wends 
nd back through all 1 
His mandate sends. 



And back through all that shining host 



[86] 



THE RAVAGED VILLA 

In shards the sylvan vases lie, 

Their links of dance undone, 
And brambles wither by thy brim. 

Choked fomitain of the sun! 
The spider in the laurel spins. 

The weed exiles the flower : 
And, flung to kiln, Apollo's bust 

Makes lime for Mammon's tower. 



[87] 



THE NEW ZEALOT 

TO THE SUN 

Persian J you rise 

Aflame from climes of sacrifice 

Where adulators sue, 
And prostrate man, with brow abased, 
Adheres to rites whose tenor traced 

All worship hitherto. 

Arch type of sway. 
Meetly your over-ruling ray 

You fling from Asia's plain, 
Whence flashed the javelins abroad 
Of many a wild incursive horde 

Led by some shepherd Cain. 

Mid terrors dinned 
Gods too came conquerors from your Ind, 

The book of Brahma throve ; 
They came like to the scj^thed car. 
Westward tliey rolled their empire far, 

Of night their purple wove. 

Chemist, you breed 
In orient climes each sorcerous weed 
That enerffizes dream — 

[88] 



Transmitted, spread in myths and creeds, 
Houris and hells, delirious screeds 
And Calvin's last extreme. 

What though your light 
In time's first dawn compelled the flight 

Of Chaos' startled clan, 
Shall never all your darted spears 
Disperse worse Anarchs, frauds and fears, 

Sprung from these weeds to man? 

But Science yet 
An effluence ampler shall beget, 

And power beyond your play — 
Shall quell the shades you fail to rout, 
Yea, searching every secret out 

Elucidate your ray. 



[89] 



MONODY 

To have knoAvn him, to have loved him 

After loneness long ; 
And then to be estranged in life, 

And neither in the wrong ; 
And now for death to set his seal — 

Ease me, a little ease, my song! 

By wintiy hills his hermit-mound 
The sheeted snow-di'ifts drape. 

And houseless there the snow-bird flits 
Beneath the fir-trees' crape : 

Glazed now with ice the cloistral vine 
That hid the shyest grape. 



[90] 



LONE FOUNTS 

Though fast youth's glorious fable flies, 
View not the world with worldling's eyes ; 
Nor turn with weather of the time. 
Foreclose the coming of surprise : 
Stand where Posterity shall stand ; 
Stand where the Ancients stood before, 
And, dipping in lone founts thy hand. 
Drink of the never-varying lore : 
Wise once, and wise thence evermore. 



[91] 



THE BENCH OF BOORS 

In bed I muse on Tenier's boors, 
Embrowned and beerj'^ losels all ; 

A wakeful brain 

Elaborates pain: 
Within low doors the slugs of boors 
Laze and yawn and doze again. 

In dreams they doze, the drowsy boors, 
Their hazy hovel warm and small : 

Thought's ampler bound 

But chill is found : 
Within low doors the basking boors 
Snugly hug the ember-mound. 

Sleepless, I see the slumberous boors 
Their blurred eyes blink, their eyelids fall : 

Thought's eager sight 

Aches — overb right ! 
Within low doors the boozy boors 
Cat-naps take in pipe-bowl light. 



[92] 



ART 

In placid hours well-pleased we dream 
Of many a brave mibodied scheme. 
But form to lend, pulsed life create, 
What unlike things must meet and mate ; 
A flame to melt — a wind to freeze ; 
Sad patience — joyous energies; 
Humility — yet pride and scorn ; 
Instinct and study ; love and hate ; 
Audacity — reverence. These must mate, 
And fuse with Jacob's mystic heart, 
To wrestle with the angel — Art. 



[93] 



THE ENTHUSIAST 

"Though He slay me yet xvill I trust in Him." 

Shall hearts that beat no base retreat 
In youth's magnanimous years — 

Ignoble hold it, if discreet 

When interest tames to fears ; 

Shall spirits that worship light 
Perfidious deem its sacred glow, 
Recant, and trudge where worldlings go, 

Conform and own them right ? 

Shall Time with creeping influence cold 

Unnerve and cow? the heart 
Pine for the heartless ones enrolled 

With palterers of the mart? 
Shall faith abjure her skies. 

Or pale probation blench her down 

To shrink from Truth so still, so lone 
]Mid loud gregarious lies? 



[94] 



Each burning boat in Caesar's rear, 
Flames — No return through me ! 

So put the torch to ties though dear, 
If ties but tempters be. 

Nor cringe if come the night : 

Walk through the cloud to meet the pall, 
Though light forsake thee, never fall 

From fealty to light. 



[95] 



SHELLEY'S VISION 

Wandering late by morning seas 

When my heart with pain was low- 
Hate the censor pelted me — 
Deject I saw my shadow go. 

In elf-caprice of bitter tone 
I too would pelt the pelted one : 
At my shadow I cast a stone. 

When lo, upon that sun-lit ground 
I saw the quivering phantom take 

The likeness of St. Stephen crowned : 
Then did self -reverence awake. 



[96] 



THE MARCHIONESS 
OF BRINVILLIERS 

He toned the sprightly beam of morning 
With twihght meek of tender eve, 

Brightness interfused with softness, 
Light and shade did weave : 

And gave to candor equal place 

With mystery starred in open skies ; 

And, floating all in sweetness, made 
Her fathomless mild eyes. 



[97] 



THE AGE OF THE 
ANTONINES 

While faith forecasts millennial years 

Spite Europe's embattled lines, 
Back to the Past one glance be cast — 

The Age of the Antonines ! 
O sunmiit of fate, O zenith of time 
When a pagan gentleman reigned. 
And the olive was nailed to the inn of the 

world 
IS'or the peace of the just was feigned. 

A halcyon Age, afar it shines. 

Solstice of Man and the Antonines. 

Hymns to the nations' friendly gods 

Went up from the fellowly shrines, 

No demagogue beat the pulpit-drum 
In the Age of the Antonines ! 

The sting was not dreamed to be taken from 
death, 

No Paradise pledged or sought, 

But they reasoned of fate at the flowing feast. 

Nor stifled the fluent thought. 

We sham, we shuffle while faith declines — 
They were frank in the Age of the 
Antonines. 

[98] 



Orders and ranks they kept degree, 

Few felt how the parvenu pines, 

No law-maker took the lawless one's fee 
In the Age of the Antonines ! 

Under law made will the world reposed 

And the ruler's right confessed, 

For the heavens elected the Emperor then, 

The foremost of men the best. 

Ah, might we read in America's signs 
The Age restored of the Antonines. 



[99] 



HERBA SANTA 

I 

Aftek long wars when comes release 
Not olive wands proclaiming peace 

Can import dearer share 
Than stems of Herba Santa hazed 

In autumn's Indian air. 
Of moods they breathe that care disarm, 
They pledge us lenitive and calm. 

II 

Shall code or creed a lure afford 
To win all selves to Love's accord? 
When Love ordained a supper divine 

For the wide world of man, 
What bickerings o'er his gracious wine ! 

Then strange new feuds began. 

Effectual more in lowlier way, 
Pacific Herb, thy sensuous plea 

The bristling clans of Adam sway 
At least to fellowship in thee ! 

Before thine altar tribal flags are furled, 

Fain wouldst thou make one hearthstone of 
the world. 



[100] 



Ill 

To scythe, to sceptre, pen and hod — 

Yea, sodden laborers dumb ; 
To brains overplied, to feet that plod, 
In solace of the Truce of God 

The Calumet has come ! 

IV 

Ah for the world ere Raleigh's find 
Never that knew this suasive balm 

That helps when Gilead's fails to heal. 
Helps by an interserted charm. 

Insinuous thou that through the nerve 
Windest the soul, and so canst win 

Some from repinings, some from sin. 
The Church's aim thou dost subserve. 

The ruffled fag fordone with care 

And brooding, God would ease this pain : 

Him soothest thou and smoothest down 
Till some content return again. 

Even ruffians feel thy influence breed 
Saint Martin's summer in the mind. 
They feel this last evangel plead. 



[101] 



As did the first, apart from creed, 
Be peaceful, man — be kind ! 

V 

Rejected once on higher plain, 
O Love supreme, to come again 

Can this be thine? 
Again to come, and win us too 

In likeness of a weed 
That as a god didst vainly woo. 

As man more vainly bleed? 

VI 

Forbear, my soul! and in thine Eastern 
chamber 
Rehearse the dream that brings the long 
release : 
Through jasmine sweet and talismanic amber 
Inhaling Herba Santa in the passive Pipe 
of Peace. 



[102] 



OFF CAPE COLONNA 

Aloof they crown the foreland lone, 
From aloft they loftier rise — 

Fair columns, in the aureole rolled 
From sunned Greek seas and skies. 

They wax, sublimed to fancy's view, 

A god-like group against the blue. 

Over much like gods ! Serene they saw 
The wolf- waves board the deck, 

And headlong hull of Falconer, 
And many a deadlier wreck. 



[103] 



THE APPARITION 

The Parthenon uplifted on its rock first challenging 
the viexv on the approach to Athens. 

Abrupt the supernatural Cross, 

Vivid in startled air, 
Smote the Emperor Constantine 
And turned his soul's allegiance there. 

With other power appealing down, 

Trophy of Adam's best ! 
If cynic minds you scarce convert, 
You try them, shake them, or molest. 

Diogenes, that honest heart, 

Lived ere your date began ; 
Thee had he seen, he might have swerved 
In mood nor barked so much at Man. 



[104] 



L'ENVOI 

The Return of the Sire de JVesle. 
A.D. 16 — 

My towers at last ! These rovings end, 
Their thirst is slaked in larger dearth : 
The yearning infinite recoils, 
For terrible is earth. 

Kaf thrusts his snouted crags through fog : 
Araxes swells beyond his span. 
And knowledge poured by pilgrimage 
Overflows the banks of man. 

But thou, my stay, thy lasting love 
One lonely good, let this but be ! 
Weary to view the wide world's swarm, 
But blest to fold but thee. 



[105] 



SUPPLEMENT 



SUPPLEMENT 

WERE I fastidiously anxious for the sym- 
metry of this book, it would close with the 
notes. But the times are such that patriotism — 
not free from solicitude — urges a claim over- 
riding all literary scruples. 

It is more than a year since the memorable 
surrender, but events have not yet rounded 
themselves into completion. Not justly can we 
complain of this. There has been an upheaval 
affecting the basis of things; to altered cir- 
cumstances complicated adaptations are to be 
made; there are difficulties great and novel. 
But is Reason still waiting for Passion to 
spend itself ? We have sung of the soldiers and 
sailors, but who shall hymn the politicians? 

In view of the infinite desirableness of Re- 
establishment, and considering that, so far as 
feeling is concerned, it depends not mainly on 
the temper in which the South regards the 
North, but rather conversely; one who never 
was a blind adherent feels constrained to sub- 



[109] 



mit some thoughts, counting on the indulgence 
of his countrymen. 

And, first, it may be said that, if among the 
f eehngs and opinions growing immediately out 
of a great civil convulsion, there are any wliich 
time shall modify or do away, they are pre- 
sumably those of a less temperate and charita- 
ble cast. 

There seems no reason why patriotism and 
narrowness should go together, or why intel- 
lectual impartiality should be confounded ^vith 
political trimming, or why serviceable truth 
should keep cloistered because not partisan. 
Yet the work of Reconstruction, if admitted 
to be feasible at all, demands little but common 
sense and Christian charity. Little but these? 
These are much. 

Some of us are concerned because as yet the 
South shows no penitence. But what exactly 
do we mean by this? Since down to the close 
of the war she never confessed any for braving 
it, the only penitence now left her is that which 
springs solely from the sense of discomfiture ; 
and since this evidently would be a contrition 
hypocritical, it would be imworthy in us to 
demand it. Certain it is that penitence, in the 



[110] 



sense of voluntary humiliation, will never be 
displayed. Nor does tliis afford just ground 
for unreserved condemnation. It is enough, 
for all practical purposes, if the South have 
been taught by the terrors of civil war to feel 
that Secession, like Slavery, is against Des- 
tiny; that both now lie buried in one grave; 
that her fate is linked with ours ; and that to- 
gether we comprise the Nation. 

The clouds of heroes who battled for the 
Union it is needless to eulogize here. But how 
of the soldiers on the other side? And when of 
a free community we name the soldiers, we 
thereby name the people. It was in subservi- 
ency to the slave-interest that Secession was 
plotted; but it was under the plea, plausibly 
urged, that certain inestimable rights guaran- 
teed by the Constitution were directly men- 
aced, that the people of the South were cajoled 
into revolution. Through the arts of the con- 
spirators and the perversity of fortune, the 
most sensitive love of liberty was entrapped 
into the support of a war whose implied end 
was the erecting in our advanced century of 
an Anglo-American empire based upon the 
systematic degradation of man. 



[Ill] 



Spite this clinging reproach, however, signal 
military virtues and achievements have con- 
ferred upon the Confederate arms historic 
fame, and upon certain of the commanders a 
renown extending beyond the sea — a renown 
which we of the North could not suppress, 
even if we would. In personal character, also, 
not a few of the military leaders of the South 
enforce forbearance ; the memoiy of others the 
North refrains from disparaging; and some, 
with more or less of reluctance, she can respect. 
Posterity, sympathizing with our convictions, 
but removed from our passions, may perhaps 
go farther here. If George IV could, out of 
the graceful instinct of a gentleman, raise an 
honorable monument in the great fane of 
Christendom over the remains of the enemy of 
his dynasty, Charles Edward, the invader of 
England and victor in the rout of Preston 
Pans — upon whose head the king's ancestor 
but one reign removed had set a price — is it 
probable that the granchildi'en of General 
Grant will pursue with rancor, or slur by sour 
neglect, the memory of Stonewall Jackson? 

But the South herself is not wanting in re- 
cent histories and biographies which record the 



[112] 



deeds of her chieftains — writings freely pub- 
lished at the North by loyal houses, widely read 
here, and with a deep though saddened inter- 
est. By students of the war such works are 
hailed as welcome accessories, and tending to 
the completeness of the record. 

Supposing a happy issue out of present per- 
plexities, then, in the generation next to come, 
Southerners there will be yielding allegiance 
to the Union, feeling all their interests bound 
up in it, and yet cherishing unrebuked that 
kind of feeling for the memory of the soldiers 
of the fallen Confederacy that Burns, Scott, 
and the Ettrick Shepherd felt for the memory 
of the gallant clansmen ruined through their 
fidelity to the Stuarts — a feeling whose pas- 
sion was tempered by the poetry imbuing it, 
and which in no wise affected their loyalty to 
the Georges, and which, it may be added, indi- 
rectly contributed excellent things to litera- 
ture. But, setting this view aside, dishonorable 
would it be in the South were she willing to 
abandon to shame the memory of brave men 
who with signal personal disinterestedness 
warred in her behalf, though from motives, as 
we believe, so deplorably astray. 



[113] 



Patriotism is not baseness, neither is it inhu- 
manity. The mourners who this sunmier bear 
flowers to the mounds of the Virginian and 
Georgian dead are, in their domestic bereave- 
ment and proud affection, as sacred in the eye 
of Heaven as are those who go with similar of- 
ferings of tender gi'ief and love into the ceme- 
teries of our Northern martyrs. And yet, in one 
aspect, how needless to point the contrast. 

Cherishing such sentiments, it will hardly 
occasion surprise that, in looking over the bat- 
tle-pieces in the foregoing collection, I have 
been tempted to withdraw or modify some of 
them, fearful lest in presenting, though but 
dramatically and by way of poetic record, the 
passions and epithets of civil war, I might be 
contributing to a bitterness which eveiy sensi- 
ble American must wish at an end. So, too, 
with the emotion of victory as reproduced on 
some pages, and particularly toward the close. 
It should not be construed into an exultation 
misapplied — an exultation as ungenerous as 
unwise, and made to minister, however indi- 
rectly, to that kind of censoriousness too apt 
to be produced in certain natures by success 
after trying reverses. Zeal is not of necessity 



[114] 



religion, neither is it always of the same essence 
with poetry or patriotism. 

There are excesses which marked the con- 
flict, most of which are perhaps inseparable 
from a civil strife so intense and prolonged, 
and involving warfare in some border coun- 
tries new and imperfectly civilized. Barbarities 
also there were, for which the Southern people 
collectively can hardly be held responsible, 
though perpetrated by ruffians in their name. 
But surely other qualities — exalted ones — 
courage and fortitude matchless, were likewise 
displayed, and largely; and justly may these 
be held the characteristic traits, and not the 
former. 

In this view, what Northern writer, how- 
ever patriotic, but must revolt from acting on 
paper a part any way akin to that of the live 
dog to the dead lion; and yet it is right to 
rejoice for our triumphs, so far as it may just- 
ly imply an advance for our whole country and 
for humanity. 

Let it be held no reproach to any one that 
he pleads for reasonable consideration for our 
late enemies, now stricken down and unavoid- 
ably debarred, for the time, from speaking 



[115] 



through authorized agencies for themselves. 
Nothing has been urged here in the fooHsh 
hope of conciHating those men — few in num- 
ber, we trust — who have resolved never to be 
reconciled to the Union. On such hearts every- 
thing is thrown away except it be religious 
commiseration, and the sincerest. Yet let them 
call to mind that unhappy Secessionist, not a 
military man, who with impious alacrity fired 
the first shot of the Civil War at Sumter, and 
a little more than four years afterward fired 
the last one into his heart at Riclmiond. 

Noble was the gesture into which patriotic 
passion surprised the people in a utilitarian 
time and country; yet the glory of the war 
falls short of its pathos — a pathos which now 
at last ought to disarm all animosity. 

How many and earnest thoughts still rise, 
and how hard to repress them. We feel what 
past years have been, and years, unretarded 
years, shall come. May we all have modera- 
tion; may we all show candor. Though, per- 
haps, nothing could ultimately' have averted 
the strife, and though to treat of hmnan actions 
is to deal wholly with second causes, neverthe- 
less, let us not cover up or try to extenuate 



[116] 



what, humanly speaking, is the truth — name- 
ly, that those unfraternal denunciations, con- 
tinued through years, and which at last in- 
flamed to deeds that ended in bloodshed, were 
reciprocal; and that, had the preponderating 
strength and the prospect of its unlimited in- 
crease lain on the other side, on ours might 
have lain those actions which now in our late 
opponents we stigmatize under the name of 
Rebellion. As frankly let us own — what it 
would be unbecoming to parade were foreign- 
ers concerned — that our triumph was won not 
more by skill and bravery than by superior 
resources and crushing numbers ; that it was a 
triumph, too, over a people for years politic- 
ally misled by designing men, and also by some 
honestly-erring men, who from their position 
could not have been otherwise than broadly in- 
fluential; a people who, though, indeed, they 
sought to perpetuate the curse of slavery, and 
even extend it, were not the authors of it, but 
(less fortunate, not less righteous than we), 
were the fated inheritors ; a people who, having 
a like origin with ourselves, share essentially 
in whatever worthy qualities we may possess. 
No one can add to the lasting reproach which 



[117] 



(/ 



hopeless defeat has now cast upon Secession by- 
withholding the recognition of these verities. 

Surely we ought to take it to heart that that 
kind of pacification, based upon principles 
operating equally all over the land, which 
lovers of their country yearn for, and which 
our arms, though signally triumphant, did not 
bring about, and which lawmaking, however 
anxious, or energetic, or repressive, never by 
itself can achieve, may yet be largely aided 
by generosity of sentiment public and private. 
Some revisionary legislation and adaptive is 
indispensable; but with this should harmoni- 
ously work another kind of prudence, not vm- 
allied with entire magnanimity. Benevolence 
and policy — Christianity and Machiavelli — 
dissuade from penal severities toward the sub- 
dued. Abstinence here is as obligatory as con- 
siderate care for our unfortunate fellowmen 
late in bonds, and, if observed, would equally 
prove to be wise forecast. The great qualities 
of the South, those attested in the War, we can 
perilously alienate, or we may make them na- 
tionally available at need. 

The blacks, in their infant pupilage to free- 
dom, appeal to the sympathies of every hu- 



[118] 



mane mind. The paternal guardianship which 
for the interval government exercises over 
them was prompted equally by duty and be- 
nevolence. Yet such kindhness should not be 
allowed to exclude kindliness to communities 
who stand nearer to us in nature. For the 
future of the freed slaves we may well be con- 
cerned; but the future of the whole country, 
involving the future of the blacks, urges a 
paramount claim upon our anxiety. Effective 
benignity, like the Nile, is not narrow in its 
bounty, and true pohcy is always broad. To be 
sure, it is vain to seek to glide, with moulded 
words, over the difficulties of the situation. 
And for them who are neither partisans, nor 
enthusiasts, nor theorists, nor cynics, there are 
some doubts not readily to be solved. And there 
are fears. Why is not the cessation of war now 
at length attended with the settled calm of 
peace? Wherefore in a clear sky do we still 
turn our eyes toward the South as the Nea- 
politan, months after the eruption, turns his 
toward Vesuvius ? Do we dread lest the repose 
may be deceptive ? In the recent convulsion has 
the crater but shifted? Let us revere that sacred 
uncertainty which forever impends over men 



[119] 



and nations. Those of us who always abhorred 
slavery as an atheistical iniquity, gladly we 
join in the exulting chorus of humanity over 
its downfall. But we should remember that 
emancipation was accomplished not by delib- 
erate legislation; only through agonized vio- 
lence could so mighty a result be effected. In 
our natural solicitude to confirm the benefit of 
liberty to the blacks, let us forbear from meas- 
ures of dubious constitutional rightfulness to- 
ward our white countrymen — measures of a na- 
ture to provoke, among other of the last evils, 
exterminating hatred of race toward race. In 
imagination let us place ourselves in the un- 
precedented position of the Southerners — their 
position as regards the millions of ignorant 
manumitted slaves in their midst, for whom 
some of us now claim the suffrage. Let us be 
Christians toward our fellow-whites, as well 
as philanthropists toward the blacks, our fel- 
low-men. In all things, and toward all, we are 
enjoined to do as we would be done by. Nor 
should we forget that benevolent desires, after 
passing a certain point, can not undei-take their 
own fulfillment without incurring the risk of 
evils beyond those sought to be remedied. 



[120] 



Something may well be left to the graduated 
care of future legislation, and to heaven. In 
one point of view the co-existence of the two 
races in the South, whether the negro be bond 
or free, seems (even as it did to Abraham Lin- 
coln) a grave evil. Emancipation has ridded 
the country of the reproach, but not wholly of 
the calamity. Especially in the present trans- 
ition period for both races in the South, more 
or less of trouble may not unreasonably be an- 
ticipated ; but let us not hereafter be too swift 
to charge the blame exclusively in any one 
quarter. With certain evils men must be more 
or less patient. Our institutions have a potent 
digestion, and may in time convert and assimi- 
late to good all elements thrown in, however 
originally alien. 

But, so far as immediate measures looking 
toward permanent Re-establishment are con- 
cerned, no consideration should tempt us to 
pervert the national victory into oppression 
for the vanquished. Should plausible promise 
of eventual good, or a deceptive or spurious 
sense of duty, lead us to essay this, count we 
must on serious consequences, not the least of 
which would be divisions among the Northern 



[121] 



adherents of the Union. Assuredly, if any hon- 
est Catos there be who thus far have gone with 
us, no longer will they do so, but oppose us, 
and as resolutely as hitherto they have sup- 
ported. But this path of thought leads toward 
those waters of bitterness from which one can 
only turn aside and be silent. 

But supposing Re-establishment so far ad- 
vanced that the Southern seats in Congress are 
occupied, and by men qualified in accordance 
with those cardinal principles of representa- 
tive government which hitherto have prevailed 
in the land — what then? Why, the Congress- 
men elected by the people of the South will — 
represent the people of the South. This may 
seem a flat conclusion; but, in view of the last 
five years, may there not be latent signifi- 
cance in it ? What will be the temper of those 
Southern members? and, confronted bj'' them, 
what will be the mood of our own representa- 
tives ? In private life true reconciliation seldom 
follows a violent quarrel; but, if subsequent 
intercourse be unavoidable, nice observances 
and mutual are indispensable to the preven- 
tion of a new rupture. Amity itself can only 
be maintained bj^ reciprocal respect, and true 



[122] 



friends are punctilious equals. On the floor of 
Congress North and South are to come to- 
gether after a passionate duel, in which the 
South, though proving her valor, has been 
made to bite the dust. Upon differences in 
debate shall acrimonious recriminations be ex- 
changed? Shall censorious superiority assumed 
by one section provoke defiant self-assertion 
on the other? Shall Manassas and Chicka- 
mauga be retorted for Chattanooga and Rich- 
mond? Under the supposition that the full 
Congress will be composed of gentlemen, all 
this is impossible. Yet, if otherwise, it needs 
no prophet of Israel to foretell the end. The 
maintenance of Congressional decency in the 
future will rest mainly with the North. Right- 
ly will more forbearance be required from the 
North than the South, for the North is victor. 
But some there are who may deem these lat- 
ter thoughts inapplicable, and for this reason : 
Since the test-oath operatively excludes from 
Congress all who in any way participated in 
Secession, therefore none but Southerners 
wholly in harmony with the North are eligible 
to seats. This is true for the time being. But 
the oath is alterable ; and in the wonted fluctu- 



[123] 



ations of parties not improbably it will under- 
go alteration, assuming such a form, perhaps, 
as not to bar the admission into the National 
Legislature of men who represent the popula- 
tions lately in revolt. Such a result would in- 
volve no violation of the principles of demo- 
cratic government. Not readily can one per- 
ceive how the political existence of the millions 
of late Secessionists can permanently be ig- 
nored by this Republic. The years of the war 
tried our devotion to the Union; the time of 
peace may test the sincerity of our faith in 
democracy. 

In no spirit of opposition, not by way of 
challenge, is anything here thrown out. These 
thoughts are sincere ones ; thev seem natural — 
inevitable. Here and there thej^ must have sug- 
gested themselves to many thoughtful patri- 
ots. And, if they be just thoughts, ere long 
they must have that weight with the public 
which already they have had with individuals. 

For that heroic band — those children of the 
furnace who, in regions like Texas and Ten- 
nessee, maintained their fidelity through ter- 
rible trials — we of the North felt for them, 
and profoundly we honor them. Yet passion- 



[124] 



ate sympathy, with resentments so close as to 
be ahnost domestic in their bitterness, would 
hardly in the present juncture tend to discreet 
legislation. Were the Unionists and Secession- 
ists but as Guelphs and Ghibellines? If not, 
then far be it from a great nation now to act in 
the spirit that animated a triumphant town- 
faction in the Middle Ages. But crowding 
thoughts must at last be checked ; and, in times 
like the present, one who desires to be impar- 
tially just in the expression of his views, moves 
as among sword-points presented on every 
side. 

Let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy 
of our time may not have been enacted without 
instructing our whole beloved country through 
terror and pity ; and may fulfillment verify in 
the end those expectations which kindle the 
bards of Progress and Humanity.

POEMS FROM 
BATTLE PIECES 



THE PORTENT 

1859 

Hanging from the beam, 

Slowly swaying (such the law) , 

Gamit the shadow on your green, 
Shenandoah I 

The cut is on the crown 

(Lo, John Brown) , 

And the stabs shall heal no more. 

Hidden in the cap 

Is the anguish none can draw ; 
So youi' future veils its face, 

Shenandoah! 
But the streaming beard is shown 
(Weird John Brown) , 
The meteor of the war. 



[129] 



FROM THE CONFLICT 
OF CONVICTIONS 

1860-1 

The Ancient of Days forever is young, 
Forever the scheme of Nature thrives ; 

I know a wind in purpose strong — 
It spins against the way it drives. 

Wliat if the gulfs their shmed foundations 
bare? 

So deep must the stones be hurled 

Whereon the tjiroes of ages rear 

The final empire and the happier world. 

Power unanointed may come — 
Dominion (unsought by the free) 

And the Iron Dome, 
Stronger for stress and strain. 
Fling her huge shadow athwart the main ; 
But the Founders' dream shall flee. 
Age after age has been, 
(From man's changeless heart their way they 

win) ; 
And death be busy with all who strive — 
Death, with silent negative. 



[130] 



Yea and May — 

Each hath his say; 

But God He keeps the middle way. 

None was by 

When He spread the sky; 

Wisdom is vain, and prophecy. 



[131] 



THE MARCH INTO VIRGINIA 

Ending in the First Manassas 
July, 1861 

Did all the lets and bars appear 

To every just or larger end, 
Whence should come the trust and cheer? 

Youth must its ignorant impulse lend — 
Age finds place in the rear. 

All wars are boyish, and are fought by boys, 
The champions and enthusiasts of the state : 

Turbid ardors and vain joys 
Not barrenly abate — 

Stimulants to the power mature, 
Preparatives of fate. 

Who here f orecasteth the event ? 
What heart but spurns at precedent 
And warnings of the wise. 
Contemned foreclosures of surprise ? 
The banners play, the bugles call, 
The air is blue and prodigal. 

No berrying party, pleasure-wooed. 
No picnic party in the May, 
Ever went less loth than they 

Into that leafy neighborhood. 
In Bacchic glee they file toward Fate, 



[132] 



Moloch's uninitiate ; 
Expectancy, and glad surmise 
Of battle's unknown mysteries. 
All they feel is this : 't is glory, 
A rapture sharp, though transitory. 
Yet lasting in belaureled story. 
So they gayly go to fight. 
Chatting left and laughing right. 

But some who this blithe mood present, 
As on in lightsome files they fare. 

Shall die experienced ere three days are 
spent — 
Perish, enlightened by the vollied glare ; 

Or shame survive, and, like to adamant. 
The throe of Second Manassas share. 



[133] 



BALL'S BLUFF 

A Reverie 
October, 1861 

One noonday, at my window in the town, 
I saw a sight — saddest that eyes can see — 
Young soldiers marching lustily 
Unto the wars, 

With fifes, and flags in mottoed pageantry ; 
While all the porches, walks, and doors 

Were rich with ladies cheering royally. 

They moved like Juny morning on the wave, 
Their hearts were fresh as clover in its prime 
( It was the breezy summer time) , 
Life throbbed so strong. 
How should they dream that Death in a rosy 
clime 
Would come to thin their shining throng? 
Youth feels immortal, like the gods sublime. 



[134] 



Weeks passed ; and at my window, leaving 
bed, 
By night I mused, of easeful sleep bereft, 
On those brave boys (Ah War! thy theft) ; 
Some marching feet 
Found pause at last by chff s Potomac cleft ; 

Wakeful I mused, while in the street 
Far footfalls died away till none were left. 



[135] 



THE STONE FLEET 

An Old Sailor's Lament 
December, 1861 

I HAVE a feeling for those ships, 

Each worn and ancient one, 
With great bluff bows, and broad in the beam : 
Ay, it was unkindly done. 

But so they serve the Obsolete — 
Even so. Stone Fleet ! 

You'll say I'm doting; do you think 

I scudded round the Horn in one — 
The Tenedos, a glorious 

Good old craft as ever run — 

Sunk (how all unmeet!) 
With the Old Stone Fleet. 

An India sliip of fame was she. 

Spices and shawls and fans she bore ; 
A whaler when the wrinkles came — 
Turned off! till, spent and poor. 

Her bones were sold (escheat) ! 
All! Stone Fleet. 



[136] 



Four were erst patrician keels 

(Names attest what families be) , 
The Kensington, and Richmond too, 
Leonidas, and Lee : 

But now they have their seat 
With the Old Stone Fleet. 

To scuttle them — a pirate deed — 

Sack them, and dismast; 
They sunk so slow, they died so hard. 
But gurgling dropped at last. 

Their ghosts in gales repeat 
Woe's us. Stone Fleet! 

And all for naught. The waters pass — 

Currents will have their way ; 
Nature is nobody's ally; 'tis well; 
The harbor is bettered — will stay. 
A failure, and complete, 
Was your Old Stone Fleet. 



[137] 



THE TEMERAIRE 

Supposed to have been suggested to an Englishman of 

the old order by the fight of the 

Monitor and M errimac 

The gloomy hulls in armor grim, 
Like clouds o'er moors have met, 

And prove that oak, and iron, and man 
Are tough in fibre yet. 

But Splendors wane. The sea-fight yields 

No front of old display ; 
The garniture, emblazonment, 

And heraldry all decay. 

Towering afar in parting light, 

The fleets hke Albion's forelands shine- 
The full-sailed fleets, the shrouded show 

Of Ships-of-the-Line. 

The fighting Temeraire, 
Built of a thousand trees. 

Lunging out her lightnings, 
And beetling o'er the seas — 

O Ship, how brave and fair. 
That fought so oft and well, 



[138] 



On open decks you manned the gun 

Armorial. 
What cheerings did you share, 

Impulsive in the van, 
When down upon leagued France and 
Spain 

We English ran — 
The freshet at your bowsprit 

Like the foam upon the can. 
Bickering, your colors 

Licked up the Spanish air, 
You flapped with flames of battle-flags- 

Your challenge, Temeraire! 
The rear ones of our fleet 

They yearned to share your place. 
Still vying with the Victory 
Throughout that earnest race — 
The Victory, whose Admiral, 

With orders nobly won, 
Shone in the globe of the battle glow — 

The angel in that sun. 
Parallel in story, 

Lo, the stately pair, 
As late in grapple ranging, 

The foe between them there — 
When four great hulls lay tiered, 



[139] 



And the fiery tempest cleared, 
And your prizes twain appeared, 
Temeraire! 

But Trafalgar is over now. 

The quarter-deck undone ; 
The carved and castled navies fire 

Their evening-gun. 
O, Titan Temeraire, 

Your stern-lights fade away ; 
Your bulwarks to the years must yield. 

And heart-of-oak decay. 
A pigmy steam-tug tows you, 

Gigantic, to the shore — 
Dismantled of your guns and spars. 

And sweeping wings of war. 
The rivets clinch the iron clads, 

Men leam a deadlier lore ; 
But Fame has nailed your battle-flags — 

Your ghost it sails before : 
O, the navies old and oaken, 

O, the Temeraire no more! 



[140] 



A UTILITARIAN VIEW OF 
THE MONITOR'S FIGHT 

Plain be the phrase, yet apt the verse, 

More ponderous than nimble ; 
For since grimed War here laid aside 
His Orient pomp, 'twould ill befit 
Overmuch to ply 
The rhyme's barbaric cymbal. 

Hail to victory without the gaud 
Of glory ; zeal that needs no fans 
Of banners ; plain mechanic power 
Plied cogently in War now placed — 
Where War belongs — 
Among the trades and artisans. 

Yet this was battle, and intense — 
Beyond the strife of fleets heroic ; 

Deadlier, closer, calm 'mid storm ; 

No passion ; all went on by crank. 
Pivot, and screw, 
And calculations of caloric. 



[141] 



Needless to dwell ; the story's known. 

The ringmg of those plates on plates 
Still ringeth round the world — 
The clangor of that blacksmiths' fray. 
The anvil-din 

Resounds this message from the Fates : 

War shall yet be, and to the end ; 

But war-paint shows the streaks of weather; 
War yet shall be, but warriors 
Are now but operatives ; War's made 
Less grand than Peace, 

And a singe runs through lace and feather. 



[142] 



MALVERN HILL 

July, 1862 

Ye elms that wave on Malvern Hill 

In prime of morn and May, 
Recall ye how MeClellan's men 

Here stood at bay? 
While deep within yon forest dim 

Our rigid comrades lay — 
Some with the cartridge in their mouth, 
Others with fixed arms lifted South — 

Invoking so 
The cypress glades ? Ah wilds of woe ! 

The spires of Richmond, late beheld 
Through rifts in muskct-haze. 

Were closed from view in clouds of dust 
On leaf -walled ways, 

Where streamed our wagons in caravan ; 
And the Seven Nights and Days 

Of march and fast, retreat and fight. 

Pinched our grimed faces to ghastly plight- 
Does the elm wood 

Recall the haggard beards of blood? 



[143] 



The battle-smoked flag, with stars eclipsed, 

We followed (it never fell ! ) — 
In silence husbanded our strength — 

Received their yell ; 
Till on this slope we patient turned 

With cannon ordered well ; 
Reverse we proved was not defeat ; 
But ah, the sod what thousands meet ! — 

Does JNIalvern Wood 
Bethink itself, and muse and brood? 
We elms of Malvern Hill 
Remember everything ; 
But sap the twig will fill: 
Wag the world how it will. 
Leaves must be green in Spring. 



[144] 



STONEWALL JACKSON 

Mortally wounded at Chancellorsville 
May, 1863 

The Man who fiercest charged in fight, 
Whose sword and prayer were long — 

Stonewall ! 
Even him who stoutly stood for Wrong, 

How can we praise ? Yet coming days 
Shall not forget him with this song. 

Dead is the Man whose Cause is dead, 
Vainly he died and set his seal — 

Stonewall ! 
Earnest in error, as we feel ; 

True to the thing he deemed was due, 
True as Jolin Brown or steel. 

Relentlessly he routed us ; 

But we relent, for he is low — 
Stonewall ! 

Justly his fame we outlaw ; so 
We drop a tear on the bold Virginian's bier. 

Because no wreath we owe. 



[145] 



THE HOUSE-TOP 

July, 1863 
A Might Piece 

No sleep. The sultriness pervades the air 
And binds the brain — a dense oppression, such 
As tawny tigers feel in matted shades, 
Vexing their blood and making apt for ravage. 
Beneath the stars the roofy desert spreads 
Vacant as Libya. All is hushed near by. 
Yet fitfully from far breaks a mixed surf 
Of muffled sound, the Atheist roar of riot. 
Yonder, where parching Sirius set in drought, 
Balefully glares red Arson — there — and 

there. 
The Town is taken by its rats — ship-rats 
And rats of the wharves. All civil charms 
And priestly spells which late held hearts in 

awe — 
Fear-bound, subjected to a better sway 
Than sway of self ; these like a dream dissolve. 
And man rebounds whole aeons back in 

nature. 
Hail to the low dull rumble, dull and dead, 
And ponderous drag that shakes the wall. 
Wise Draco comes, deep in the midnight roll 
Of black artillery ; he comes, tliough late ; 

[146] 



In code corroborating Calvin's creed 
And cynic tyrannies of honest kings ; 
He comes, nor parlies ; and the Town, 

redeemed, 
Gives thanks devout ; nor, being thankful, 

heeds 
The grimy slur on the Republic's faith 

implied. 
Which holds that Man is naturally good. 
And — more — is Nature's Roman, never to be 

scourged. 



[147] 



CHATTANOOGA 

November, 1863 

A KINDLING impulse seized the host 

Inspired by heaven's elastic air; 
Their hearts outran their General's plan, 

Though Grant commanded there — 

Grant, who without reserve can dare ; 
And, "Well, go on and do your will," 

■ He said, and measured the mountain then : 
So master-riders fling the rein — 

But you must know your men. 

On yester-morn in grayish mist. 

Armies like ghosts on hills had fought, 

And rolled from the cloud their thunders loud 
The Cumberlands far had caught : 
To-day the sunlit steeps are sought. 

Grant stood on cliffs whence all was plain, 
And smoked as one who feels no cares ; 

But mastered nervousness intense 
Alone such calmness wears. 

The summit-cannon plunge their flame 

Sheer down the primal wall. 
But up and up each linking troop 



[148] 



In stretching festoons crawl — 

Nor fire a shot. Such men appall 
The foe, though brave. He, from the brink. 

Looks far along the breadth of slope, 
And sees two miles of dark dots creep, 

And knows they mean the cope. 

He sees them creep. Yet here and there 
Half hid 'mid leafless groves they go ; 

As men who ply through traceries high 
Of turreted marbles show — 
So dwindle these to eyes below. 

But fronting shot and flanking shell 
Sliver and rive the inwoven ways ; 

High tops of oaks and high hearts fall, 
But never the climbing stays. 

From right to left, from left to right 

They roll the rallying cheer — 
Vie with each other, brother with brother, 

Who shall the first appear — 

What color-bearer with colors clear 
In sharp relief, like sky-drawn Grant, 

Whose cigar must now be near the stump- 
While in solicitude his back 

Heaps slowly to a hump. 



[149] 



Near and more near ; till now the flags 

Run like a catching flame ; 
And one flares highest, to peril nighest — 

He means to make a name : 

Salvos! they give him his fame. 
The staff is caught, and next the rush, 

And then the leap where death has led ; 
Flag answered flag along the crest, 

And swarms of rebels fled. 

But some who gained the envied Alp, 

And — eager, ardent, earnest there — 
Dropped into Death's wide-open arms. 
Quelled on the wing like eagles struck in 
air — 

Forever they slumber young and fair, 
The smile upon them as they died ; 

Their end attained, that end a height : 
Life was to these a dream fulfilled. 

And death a starry night. 



[150] 



ON THE PHOTOGRAPH OF A 
CORPS COMMANDER 

Ay^ man is manly. Here you see 
The warrior-carriage of the head, 

And brave dilation of the frame ; 
And lighting all, the soul that led 

In Spottsylvania's charge to victory, 
Which justifies his fame. 

A cheering picture. It is good 
To look upon a Chief like this. 
In whom the spirit moulds the form. 
Here favoring Nature, oft remiss, 

With eagle mien expressive has endued 
A man to kindle strains that warm. 

Trace back his lineage, and his sires. 
Yeoman or noble, you shall find 

Enrolled with men of Agincourt, 

Heroes who shared great Harry's mind. 

Down to us come the knightly Norman fires. 
And front the Templars bore. 



[151] 



Nothing can lift the heart of man 
Like manhood in a fellow-man. 

The thought of heaven's great King afar 

But humbles us — too weak to scan; 

But manly gi'eatness men can span, 
And feel the bonds that draw. 



[152] 



THE SWAMP ANGEL 

There is a coal-black Angel 

With a thick Afric Up, 
And he dwells (like the hunted and harried) 

In a swamp where the green frogs dip. 
But his face is against a City 

Which is over a bay of the sea, 
And he breathes with a breath that is 
blastment, 

And dooms by a far decree. 

By night there is fear in the City, 

Through the darkness a star soareth on ; 
There's a scream that screams up to the zenith, 

Then the poise of a meteor lone — 
Lighting far the pale fright of the faces, 

And downward the coming is seen ; 
Then the rush, and the burst, and the havoc, 

And wails and shrieks between. 

It comes like the thief in the gloaming; 

It comes, and none may foretell 
The place of the coming — the glaring ; 

They live in a sleepless spell 
That wizens, and withers, and whitens ; 

It ages the young, and the bloom 

[153] 



Of the maiden is ashes of roses — 

The Swamp Angel broods in his gloom. 

Swift is his messengers' going, 

But slowly he saps their halls, 
As if by delay deluding. 

They move from their crumbling walls 
Farther and farther away ; 

But the Angel sends after and after, 
By night with the flame of his ray — 

By night with the voice of his screaming — 
Sends after them, stone by stone, 

And farther walls fall, farther portals, 
And weed follows weed through the Town. 

Is this the proud City ? the scorner 

Which never would yield the ground ? 
Which mocked at the coal-black Angel ? 

The cup of despair goes round. 
Vainly he calls upon Michael 

(The white man's seraph was he,) 
For Michael has fled from his tower 

To the Angel over the sea. 
Who weeps for the woeful City 

Let him weep for our guilty kind ; 
Who joys at her wild despairing — 

Christ, the Forgiver, convert his mind. 

[154] 



SHERIDAN AT CEDAR CREEK 

October, 1864 

Shoe the steed with silver 

That bore him to the fray, 
When he heard the guns at dawning — 

Miles away ; 
When he heard them calling, calling — 

Mount ! nor stay : 

Quick, or all is lost ; 

They've surprised and stormed the post, 

They push your routed host — 
Gallop ! retrieve the day. 

House the horse in ermine — 

For the foam-flake blew 
White through the red October ; 

He thundered into view ; 
They cheered him in the looming. 
Horseman and horse they knew. 
The turn of the tide began. 
The rally of bugles ran. 
He swung his hat in the van ; 
The electric hoof-spark flew. 



[155] 



Wreathe the steed and lead him — 

For the charge he led 
Touched and turned the cypress 

Into amaranths for the head 
Of Phihp, king of riders, 

Who raised them from the dead. 
The camp (at dawning lost), 
By eve, recovered — forced, 
Rang with laughter of the host 
At belated Early fled. 

Shroud the horse in sable — 

For the mounds they heap ! 
There is firing in the Valley, 

And yet no strife they keep ; 
It is the parting volley, 
It is the pathos deep. 

There is glory for the brave 
Who lead, and nobly save, 
But no knowledge in the grave 
Where the nameless followers sleep. 



[156] 



IN THE PRISON PEN 

1864 

Listless he eyes the palisades 

And sentries in the glare ; 
'Tis barren as a pelican-beach — 

But his world is ended there. 

Nothing to do ; and vacant hands 

Bring on the idiot-pain ; 
He tries to think — to recollect, 

But the blur is on his brain. 

Around him swarm the plaining ghosts 
Like those on Virgil's shore — 

A wilderness of faces dim, 

And pale ones gashed and hoar. 

A smiting sun. No shed, no tree ; 

He totters to his lair — 
A den that sick hands dug in earth 

Ere famine wasted there, 

Or, dropping in his place, he swoons. 
Walled in by throngs that press, 

Till forth from the throngs they bear 
him dead — 
Dead in his meagreness. 

[157] 



THE COLLEGE COLONEL 

He rides at their head ; 

A crutch by his saddle just slants in view, 
One slung arm is in splints, you see, 

Yet he guides his strong steed — how 
coldly too. 

He brings his regiment home — 

Not as they filed two years before, 
But a remnant half-tattered, and battered, 

and worn. 
Like castaway sailors, who — stunned 
^y the surf's loud roar, 
Their mates dragged back and seen no 
more — 
Again and again breast the surge. 
And at last crawl, spent, to shore. 

A still rigidity and pale — 

An Indian aloofness lones his brow ; 
He has lived a thousand years 
Compressed in battle's pains and prayers, 

Marches and watches slow. 



[158] 



There are welcoming shouts, and flags ; 

Old men off hat to the Boy, 
Wreaths from gay balconies fall at his feet, 

But to him — there comes alloy. 

It is not that a leg is lost. 

It is not that an arm is maimed, 

It is not that the fever has racked — 
Self he has long disclaimed. 

But all through the Seven Days' Fight, 
And deep in the Wilderness grim, 

And in the field-hospital tent. 
And Petersburg crater, and dim 

Lean brooding in Libby, there came — 
Ah heaven ! — what truth to him. 



[159] 



THE MARTYR 

Indicative of the passion of the people on the 
I5th of April, 1865 

Good Friday was the day 

Of the prodigy and crime, 
When they killed him in his pity, 

When they killed him in his prime 
Of clemency and calm — 

When with yearning he was filled 
To redeem the evil- willed, 
And, though conqueror, be kind ; 

But they killed him in his kindness. 

In their madness and their blindness, 
And they killed him from behind. 

There is sobbing of the strong, 
And a pall upon the land; 

But the People in their weeping 
Bare the iron hand ; 

Beware the People weeping 
WTien they bare the iron hand. 

He lieth in his blood — 

The father in his face ; 
They have killed him, the Forgiver — 

The Avenger takes his place, 

[160] 



The Avenger wisely stern, 

Who in righteousness shall do 
What the heavens call him to, 
And the parricides remand ; 

For they killed him in his kindness, 
In their madness and their blindness. 
And his blood is on their hand. 

There is sobbing of the strong. 
And a pall upon the land ; 

But the People in their weeping 
Bare the iron hand : 

Beware the People weeping 
When they bare the iron hand. 



[161] 



REBEL COLOR-BEARERS 
AT SHILOH 

A plea against the vindictive cry raised by civilians 
shortly after the surrender at Appomattox 

The color-bearers facing death 

White in the whirling sulphurous wreath, 

Stand boldly out before the line ; 
Right and left their glances go, 
Proud of each other, glorying in their show ; 
Their battle-flags about them blow. 

And fold them as in flame divine : 
Such living robes are only seen 
Round martyrs burning on the green — 
And martyrs for the Wrong have been. 

Perish their Cause ! but mark the men — 
Mark the planted statues, then 
Draw trigger on them if you can. 

The leader of a patriot-band 

Even so could view rebels who so could stand ; 

And this when peril pressed him sore. 
Left aidless in the shivered front of war — 

Skulkers behind, defiant foes before, 
And fighting with a broken brand. 
The challenge in that courage rare — 



[162] 



Courage defenseless, proudly bare — 
Never could tempt him ; he could dare 
Strike up the leveled rifle there. 

Sunday at Shiloh, and the day 

When Stonewall charged — McClellan's 

crimson May, 
And Chickamauga's wave of death, 
And of the Wilderness the cypress wreath- 
All these have passed away. 
The life in the veins of Treason lags, 
Her daring color-bearers drop their flags, 
And yield. Now shall we fire ? 

Can poor spite be? 
Shall nobleness in victory less aspire 
Than in reverse? Spare Spleen her ire, 
And think how Grant met Lee. 



[163] 



AURORA BOREALIS 

Commemorative of the Dissolution of Armies 

at the Peace 

May, 1865 

What power disbands the Northern Lights 

After their steely play ? 
The lonely watcher feels an awe 
Of Nature's sway, 
As when appearing, 
He marked their flashed uprearing 
In the cold gloom — 
Retreatings and advancings, 
(Like dallyings of doom) , 
Transitions and enliancings. 
And bloody ray. 

The phantom-host has faded quite, 

Splendor and Terror gone — 
Portent or promise — and gives way 
To pale, meek Dawn ; 
The coming, going, 
Alike in wonder showing — 
Alike the God, 
Decreeing and commanding 
The million blades that glowed. 
The muster and disbanding — 
Midnight and Morn. 

[164] 



THE RELEASED REBEL 
PRISONER 

June, 1865 

Armies he's seen — the herds of war, 

But never such swarms of men 
As now in the Nineveh of the North — 

How mad the Rebelhon then ! 

And yet but dimly he divines 

The depth of that deceit, 
And superstitution of vast pride 

Humbled to such defeat. 

Seductive shone the Chiefs in arms — 
His steel the nearest magnet drew ; 

Wreathed with its kind, the Gulf- weed drives- 
'Tis Nature's wrong they rue. 

His face is hidden in his beard, 
But his heart peers out at eye — 

And such a heart ! like a mountain-pool 
Where no man passes by. 

He thinks of Hill — a brave soul gone ; 

And Ashby dead in pale disdain ; 
And Stuart with the Rupert-plume, 

Whose blue eye never shall laugh again. 

[165] 



He hears the drum ; he sees our boys 
From his wasted fields return ; 
Ladies feast them on strawberries, 
And even to kiss them yearn. 

He marks them bronzed, in soldier-trim. 

The rifle proudly borne ; 
Thev bear it for an heirloom home. 

And he — disarmed — jail- worn. 

Home, home — his heart is full of it ; 

But home he never shall see. 
Even should he stand upon the spot : 

'Tis gone! — where his brothers be. 

The cypress-moss from tree to tree 
Hangs in his Southern land ; 

As weird, from thought to thought of his 
Run memories hand in hand. 

And so he lingers — Hngers on 

In the City of the Foe— 
His cousins and his countrymen 

Who see him listless go. 



[166] 



"FORMERLY A SLAVE" 

An idealized Portrait, by E. Vedder, in the Spring 
Exhibition of the National Academy, 1865 

The sufferance of her race is shown, 

And retrospect of hfe, 
Which now too late dehverance dawns upon ; 

Yet is she not at strife. 

Her children's children they shall know 

The good withheld from her ; 
And so her reverie takes prophetic cheer — 

In spirit she sees the stir 

Far down the depth of thousand years. 

And marks the revel shine ; 
Her dusky face is lit with sober light. 

Sibylline, yet benign. 



[167] 



ON THE SLAIN COLLEGIANS 

Youth is the time when hearts are large, 

And stirring wars 
Appeal to the spirit which appeals in turn 

To the blade it draws. 
If woman incite, and duty show 

(Though made the mask of Cain) , 
Or whether it be Truth's sacred cause, 

Who can aloof remain 
That shares youth's ardor, uncooled by the 
snow 

Of wisdom or sordid gain? 

The liberal arts and nurture sweet 
Which give his gentleness to man — 

Train him to honor, lend him grace 
Through bright examples meet — 
That culture which makes never wan 
With underminings deep, but holds 
The surface still, its fitting place. 
And so gives sunniness to the face 
And bravery to the heart ; what troops 

Of generous boys in happiness thus bred — 
Saturnians through life's Tempe led, 
Went from the North and came from the 
South, 



[168] 



With golden mottoes in the mouth, 
To he down midway on a bloody bed. 

Woe for the homes of the North, 
And woe for the seats of the South : 
All who felt life's spring in prime, 
And were swept by the wind of their place and 
time — 

All lavish hearts, on whichever side, 
Of birth urbane or courage high. 
Armed them for the stirring wars — 

Armed them — some to die. 
Apollo-like in pride. 
Each would slay his Python — caught 
The maxims in his temple taught — 

Aflame with sympathies whose blaze 
Perforce enwrapped him— social laws. 

Friendship and kin, and by-gone days — 
Vows, kisses — every heart unmoors. 
And launches into the seas of wars. 
What could they else — North or South? 
Each went forth with blessings given 
By priests and mothers in the name of Heaven ; 

And honor in both was chief. 
Warred one for Right, and one for Wrong? 
So be it ; but they both were young — 
Each grape to his cluster clung, 

[169] 



All their elegies are sung. 
The anguish of maternal hearts 

Must search for balm divine ; 
But well the striplings bore their fated parts 

(The heavens all parts assign) — 
Never felt life's care or cloy. 
Each bloomed and died an unabated Boy; 
Nor dreamed what death was — thought it mere 
Sliding into some vernal sphere. 
They knew the joy, but leaped the grief, 
Like plants that flower ere comes the leaf — 
Which storms lav low in kindlv doom, 
And kill them in their flush of bloom. 



[170] 



AMERICA 

I 

Where the wings of a sunny Dome expand 
I saw a Banner in gladsome air — 
Starry, like Berenice's Hair — 
Afloat in broadened bravery there ; 
With undulating long-drawn flow, 
As tolled Brazilian billows go 
Voluminously o'er the Line. 
The Land reposed in peace below ; 

The children in their glee 
Were folded to the exulting heart 

Of young Maternity. 

II 
Later, and it streamed in fight 

When tempest mingled with the fray, 
And over the spear-point of the shaft 

I saw the ambiguous lightning play. 
Valor with Valor strove, and died : 
Fierce was Despair, and cruel was Pride ; 
And the lorn Mother speechless stood, 
Pale at the fury of her brood. 



[171] 



Ill 

Yet later, and the silk did wind 

Her fair cold form ; 
Little availed the shining shroud, 

Though ruddy in hue, to cheer or warm. 
A watcher looked upon her low, and said — 
She sleeps, but sleeps, she is not dead. 

But in that sleeps contortion showed 
The terror of the vision there — 

A silent vision unavowed, 
Revealing earth's foundation bare. 

And Gorgon in her hidden place. 
It was a thing of fear to see 

So foul a dream upon so fair a face, 
And the dreamer lying in that starry shroud. 

IV 

But from the trance she sudden broke — 

The trance, or death into promoted life ; 
At her feet a shivered yoke, 
And in her aspect turned to heaven 
'No trace of passion or of strife — 
A clear calm look. It spake of pain. 
But such as purifies from stain — 
Sharp pangs that never come again — 
And triumph repressed by knowledge meet, 



[172] 



Power dedicate, and hope grown wise, 
And youth matured for age's seat — 

Law on her brow and empire in her eyes. 
So she, with graver air and hfted flag; 

While the shadow, chased by Hght, 

Fled along the far-drawn height, 
And left her on the crag. 



[173] 



INSCRIPTION 

For Graves at Pea Ridge, Arkansas 

Let none misgive we died amiss 

When here we strove in furious fight : 
Furious it was ; nathless was this 

Better than tranquil phght, 
And tame surrender of the Cause 
Hallowed by hearts and by the laws. 

We here who warred for Man and Right, 
The choice of warring never laid with us. 

There we were ruled by the traitor's choice. 

Nor long we stood to trim and poise, 
But marched and fell — victorious ! 



[174] 



THE FORTITUDE OF 
THE NORTH 

Under the Disaster of the Second Manassas 

They take no shame for dark defeat 

While prizing yet each victory won, 
Who fight for the Right through all retreat, 

Nor pause until their work is done. 
The Cape-of-Storms is proof to every throe; 

Vainly against that foreland beat 
Wild winds aloft and wilder waves below : 
The black cliffs gleam through rents in sleet 
When the livid Antarctic storm-clouds glow. 



[175] 



THE MOUND BY THE LAKE 

The grass shall never forget this grave. 
When homeward footing it in the sun 

After the weary ride by rail, 
The stripling soldiers passed her door, 

Wounded perchance, or wan and pale, 
She left her household work undone — 
Duly the wayside table spread. 

With evergreens shaded, to regale 
Each travel-spent and grateful one. 
So warm her heart — childless — unwed. 
Who like a mother comforted. 



[176] 



ON THE SLAIN AT 
CHICKAMAUGA 

Happy are they and charmed in life 

Who through long wars arrive unscarred 
At peace. To such the wreath be given, 
If they unfalteringly have striven — 

In honor, as in limb, unmarred. 
Let cheerful praise be rife. 

And let them live their years at ease, 
Musing on brothers who victorious died — 

Loved mates whose memory shall ever please. 

And yet mischance is honorable too — 
Seeming defeat in conflict justified 

Whose end to closing eyes is hid from view. 

The will, that never can relent — 

The aim, survivor of the bafflement, 
Make this memorial due. 



[177] 



AN UNINSCRIBED 
MONUMENT 

On one of the Battle-fields of the Wilderness 

Silence and solitude may hint 

(Whose home is in yon piney wood) 
What I, though tableted, could never tell — 
The din which here befell, 

And striving of the multitude. 
The iron cones and spheres of death 

Set round me in their rust, 
These, too, if just. 
Shall speak with more than animated breath. 

Thou who beholdest, if thy thought, 
Not narrowed down to personal cheer, 
Take in the import of the quiet here — 

The after-quiet — the calm full fraught ; 
Thou too wilt silent stand — 
Silent as I, and lonesome as the land. 



[178] 



ON THE GRAVE OF A 

YOUNG CAVALRY OFFICER 

KILLED IN THE 

VALLEY OF VIRGINIA 

Beauty and youth, with manners sweet, and 
friends — 

Gold, yet a mind not unenriched had he 
Whom here low violets veil from eyes. 

But all these gifts transcended be : 
His happier fortune in this mound you see. 



[179] 



A REQUIEM 

For Soldiers lost in Ocean Transports 

When^ after storms that woodlands rue, 

To valleys comes atoning dawn, 
The robins blithe their orchard-sports renew 

And meadow-larks, no more withdrawn 
Caroling fly in the languid blue ; 
The while, from many a hid recess, 
Alert to partake the blessedness, 
The pouring mites their airy dance pursue. 

So, after ocean's ghastly gales. 
When laughing light of hoyden morning 
breaks, 

Every finny hider wakes — 

From vaults profound swims up with 
glittering scales ; 

Through the delightsome sea he sails. 
With shoals of shining tiny things 
Frolic on every wave that flings 

Against the prow its showery spray ; 
All creatures joying in the morn, 
Save them forever from joyance torn. 

Whose bark was lost where now the 
dolphins play ; 
Save them that by the fabled shore, 

Down the pale stream are washed away, 

[180] 



Far to the reef of bones are borne ; 

And never revisits them the light, 
Nor sight of long-sought land and pilot more ; 

Nor heed they now the lone bird's flight 
Round the lone spar where mid-sea surges 
pour. 



[181] 



COMMEMORATIVE OF A 
NAVAL VICTORY 

Sailors there are of the gentlest breed, 

Yet strong, like every goodly thing ; 
The discipline of arms refines. 

And the wave gives tempering. 

The damasked blade its beam can fling ; 
It lends the last grave grace : 
The hawk, the hound, and sworded nobleman 

In Titian's picture for a king, 
Are of hunter or warrior race. 

In social halls a favored guest 
In years that follow victory won, 

How sweet to feel your festal fame 
In woman's glance instinctive thrown : 
Repose is yours — your deed is known, 

It musks the amber wine ; 

It lives, and sheds a light from storied days 
Rich as October sunsets brown. 

Which make the barren place to shine. 



[182] 



But seldom the laurel wreath is seen 
Unmixed with pensive pansies dark ; 

There's a light and a shadow on every man 
Who at last attains his lifted mark — 
Nursing through night the ethereal spark. 

Elate he never can be ; 

He feels that spirit which glad had hailed his 
worth, 
Sleep in oblivion. — The shark 

Glides white through the phosphorus sea. 



[183] 



A MEDITATION 

How often in the years that close, 

AVhen truce had stilled the sieging gun, 

The soldiers, mounting on their works, 
With mutual curious glance have run 

From face to face along the fronting show, 

And kinsman spied, or friend — even in a foe. 

What thoughts conflicting then were shared. 
While sacred tenderness perforce 

Welled from the heart and wet the eye ; 
And something of a strange remorse 

Rebelled against the sanctioned sin of blood. 

And Christian wars of natural brotherhood. 

Then stirred the god within the breast — 
The witness that is man's at birth; 

A deep misgiving undermined 

Each plea and subterfuge of earth; 

They felt in that rapt pause, with warning rife, 

Horror and anguish for the civil strife. 

Of North or South they recked not then. 
Warm passion cursed the cause of war : 

Can Africa pay back this blood 
Spilt on Potomac's shore? 



[184] 



Yet doubts, as pangs, were vain the strife 

to stay. 
And hands that fain had clasped again 

could slay. 

How frequent in the camp was seen 

The herald from the hostile one, 
A guest and frank companion there 

When the proud formal talk was done ; 
The pipe of peace was smoked even 'mid the 

war, 
And fields in Mexico again fought o'er. 

In Western battle long they lay 
So near opposed in trench or pit, 

That foeman unto f oeman called 
As men who screened in tavern sit : 

"You bravely fight" each to the other said — 

"Toss us a biscuit!" o'er the wall it sped. 

And pale on those same slopes, a boy — 
A stormer, bled in noon-day glare ; 

No aid the Blue-coats then could bring, 
He cried to them who nearest were, 

And out there came 'mid howling shot and shell 

A daring foe who him befriended well. 



[185] 



Mark the great Captains on both sides, 
The soldiers with the broad renown — 

Thej'- all were messmates on the Hudson's 
marge. 
Beneath one roof they laid them down ; 

And, free from hate in many an after pass. 

Strove as in school-boy rivalry of the class. 

A darker side there is ; but doubt 
In Nature's charity hovers there : 

If men for new agreement yearn, 
Then old upbraiding best forbear: 

"The South's the sinner!" Well, so let it be; 

But shall the North sin worse, and stand the 
Pharisee ? 

O, now that brave men yield the sword, 

Mine be the manful soldier- view ; 
By how much more they boldly warred. 

By so much more is mercy due : 
When Vicksburg fell, and the moody files 

marched out. 
Silent the victors stood, scorning to raise a 
shout. 



[18G] 



POEMS FROM 
MARDI 



WE FISH 

We fish, we fish, we merrily swim. 
We care not for friend nor for foe. 

Our fins are stout. 

Our tails are out. 
As through the seas we go. 

Fish, Fish, we are fish with red gills ; 

Naught disturbs us, our blood is at zero : 
We are buoyant because of our bags, 

Being many, each fish is a hero. 
We care not what is it, this life 

That we follow, this phantom unknown ; 
To swim, it's exceedingly pleasant, — 

So swim away, making a foam. 
This strange looking thing by our side. 

Not for safety, around it we flee : — 
Its shadow's so shady, that's all, — 

We only swim under its lee. 
And as for the eels there above. 

And as for the fowls of the air. 
We care not for them nor their ways, 

As we cheerily glide afar ! 



[189] 



We fish, we fish, we merrily swim, 
We care not for friend nor for foe ; 

Our fins are stout. 

Our tails are out. 
As through the seas we go. 



[190] 



INVOCATION 

Ha^ ha, gods and kings ; fill high, one and all ; 
Drink, drink ! shout and drink ! mad respond to 

the call ! 
Fill fast, and fill full; 'gainst the goblet ne'er 

' sin ; 
Quaff there, at high tide, to the uttermost 
rim: — 

Flood-tide, and soul-tide to the brim ! 

Who with wine in him fears? who thinks of his 

cares ? 
Who sighs to be wise, when wine in him flares ? 
Water sinks down below, in currents full slow ; 
But wine mounts on high with its genial glow : — 
Welling up, till the brain overflow! 

As the spheres, with a roll, some fiery of soul, 
Others golden, with music, revolve round the 

pole; 
So let our cups, radiant with many hued wines. 
Round and round in groups circle, our Zodiac's 

Signs: — 
Round reeling, and ringing their chimes ! 



[191] 



Then drink, gods and kings ; wine merriment 

brings ; 
It bounds through the veins; there, jubilant 

sings. 
Let it ebb, then, and flow ; wine never grows 

dim; 
Drain down that bright tide at the foam beaded 

rim : — 

Fill up, every cup, to the brim ! 



[192] 



DIRGE 

We drop our dead in the sea, 
The bottomless, bottomless sea; 

Each bubble a hollow sigh. 
As it sinks forever and aye. 

We drop our dead in the sea, — 
The dead reck not of aught ; 

We drop our dead in the sea, — 
The sea ne'er gives it a thought. 

Sink, sink, oh corpse, still sink, 
Far down in the bottomless sea. 

Where the unknown forms do prowl, 
Down, down in the bottomless sea. 

'Tis night above, and night all round, 
And night will it be with thee ; 

As thou sinkest, and sinkest for aye, 
Deeper down in the bottomless sea. 



[193] 



MARLENA 

Far off in the sea is JNIarlena, 

A land of shades and streams, 

A land of many delights, 

Dark and bold, thy shores, Marlena ; 

But green, and timorous, thy soft knolls. 

Crouching behind the woodlands. 

All shady thy hills ; all gleaming thy springs, 

Like eyes in the earth looking at you. 

How charming thy haunts, Marlena ! — 

Oh, the waters that flow through Onimoo; 

Oh, the leaves that rustle through Ponoo : 

Oh, the roses that blossom in Tarma. 

Come, and see the valley of Vina : 

How sweet, how sweet, the Isles from Hina : 

'Tis aye afternoon of the full, full moon, 

And ever the season of fruit. 

And ever the hour of flowers, 

And never the time of rains and gales. 

All in and about Marlena. 

Soft sigh the boughs in the stilly air. 

Soft lap the beach the billows there ; 

And in the woods or by the streams. 

You needs must nod in the Land of Dreams. 



[194] 



PIPE SONG 

Care is all stuff : — 

Puff! Puff! 
To puff is enough : — 

Puff! Puff 
More musky than snuff, 
And warm is a puff : — 

Puff! Puff 
Here we sit mid our puffs, 
Like old lords in their ruffs. 
Snug as bears in their muffs :- 

Puff! Puff 
Then puff, puff, puff, 
For care is all stuff, 
Puffed off in a puff — 

Puff! Puff! 



[195] 



SONG OF YOOMY 

Departed the pride, and the glory of Mardi : 

The vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea, 
That rolls o'er his corse with a hush, 
His warriors bend over their spears, 
His sisters gaze upward and mourn. 
Weep, weep, for Adondo is dead! 
The sun has gone down in a shower ; 
Buried in clouds the face of the moon ; 

Tears stand in the eyes of the starry skies. 
And stand in the eyes of the flowers ; 

And streams of tears are the trickling brooks, 
Coursing adown the mountains. — 
Departed the pride, and the glory of Mardi : 
The vaunt of her isles sleeps deep in the sea. 

Fast falls the small rain on its bosom that 
sobs, — 
Not showers of rain, but the tears of Oro. 



[196] 



GOLD 

We rovers bold, 

To the land of Gold, 
Over the bowling billows are gliding : 

Eager to toil, 

For the golden spoil. 
And every hardship biding. 

See! See! 
Before our prows' resistless dashes 
The gold-fish fly in golden flashes ! 

'Neath a sun of gold. 

We rovers bold. 
On the golden land are gaining ; 

And every night. 

We steer aright. 
By golden stars unwaning! 
All fires burn a golden glare : 
No locks so bright as golden hair! 

All orange groves have golden gushings ; 

All mornings dawn with golden flushings ! 
In a shower of gold, say fables old, 
A maiden was won by the god of gold ! 

In golden goblets wine is beaming: 

On golden couches kings are dreaming ! 

The Golden Rule dries many tears ! 

The Golden Number rules the spheres ! 

[197] 



Gold, gold it is, that sways the nations : 
Gold ! gold ! the center of all rotations ! 
On golden axles worlds are turning: 
With phosphorescence seas are burning ! 
All fire-flies flame with golden gleamings ! 
Gold-hunters' hearts with golden dreamings ! 
With golden arrows kings are slain : 
With gold we'll buy a freeman's name! 
In toilsome trades, for scanty earnings, 
At home we've slaved, with stifled yearnings : 
No light ! no hope ! Oh, heavy woe ! 
When nights fled fast, and days dragged slow. 
But joyful now, with eager eye, 
Fast to the Promised Land we fly: 
Where in deep mines. 
The treasure shines ; 
Or down in beds of golden streams, 
The gold-flakes glance in golden gleams I 
How we long to sift. 
That yellow drift! 
Rivers ! Rivers ! cease your goings ! 
Sand-bars! rise, and stay the tide! 
'Till we've gained the golden flowing; 
And in the golden haven ride ! 



[198] 



THE LAND OF LOVE 

Hail! voyagers, hail! 

Whence e'er ye come, where'er ye rove, 

No calmer strand, 

No sweeter land, 
Will e'er ye view, than the Land of Love ! 

Hail ! voyagers, hail ! 
To these, our shores, soft gales invite : 

The palm plumes wave. 

The billows lave, 
And hither point fix'd stars of light ! 

Hail ! voyagers, hail ! 
Think not our groves wide brood with gloom ; 

In this, our isle. 

Bright flowers smile : 
Full urns, rose-heaped, these valleys bloom. 

Hail ! voyagers, hail ! 
Be not deceived; renounce vain things; 

Ye may not find 

A tranquil mind. 
Though hence ye sail with swiftest wings. 



[199] 



Hail ! voyagers, hail 1 
Time flies full fast; life soon is o'er; 

And ye may mourn, 

That hither borne, 
Ye left behind our pleasant shore. 



[200] 



POEMS FROM 
CLAREL 



DIRGE 

Stay^ Death, Not mine the Christus-wand 

Wherewith to charge thee and command : 

I plead. Most gently hold the hand 

Of her thou leadest far away ; 

Fear thou to let her naked feet 

Tread ashes — but let mosses sweet 

Her footing tempt, where'er ye stray. 

Shun Orcus ; win the moonlit land 

Belulled — the silent meadows lone, 

Where never any leaf is blown 

From lily-stem in Azrael's hand. 

There, till her love rejoin her lowly 

(Pensive, a shade, but all her own) 

On honey feed her, wild and holy; 

Or trance her with thy choicest charm. 

And if, ere yet the lover's free, 

Some added dusk thy rule decree — 

That shadow only let it be 

Thrown in the moon-glade by the palm.

EPILOGUE 

// Luther's day expand to Darwin's year. 
Shall that exclude the hope — foreclose the fear? 

Unmoved by all the claims our times avow, 
The ancient Sphinx still keeps the porch of 

shade ; 
And comes Despair, whom not her calm may 

cow. 
And coldly on that adamantine brow 
Scrawls undeterred his bitter pasquinade. 
But Faith (who from the scrawl indignant 

turns ) 
With blood warm oozing from her wounded 

trust, 
Inscribes even on her shards of broken urns 
The sign o' the cross — the spirit above the dust! 

Yea, ape and angel, strife and old debate — 
The harps of heaven and dreary gongs of hell ; 
Science the feud can only aggravate — 
No umpire she betwixt the chimes and knell : 
The running battle of the star and clod 
Shall run forever — if there be no God. 



[204] 



Degrees we know, unlmown in days before ; 
The light is greater, hence the shadow more ; 
And tantahzed and apprehensive Man 
Appeahng — Wherefore ripen us to pain ? 
Seems there the spokesman of dumb Nature's 
train. 

But through such strange illusions have they 
passed 
Who in life's pilgrimage have baffled striven — 
Even death may prove unreal at the last, 
And stoics be astounded into heaven. 

Then keep thy heart, though yet but 

ill-resigned — 
Clarel, thy heart, the issues there but mind ; 
That like the crocus budding through the 

snow — 
That like a swimmer rising from the deep — 
That like a burning secret which doth go 
Even from the bosom that would hoard and 

keep; 
Emerge thou mayst from the last whelming 

sea. 
And prove that death but routs life into victory.
