INTRODUCTION 

IN the text of this edition of Romeo and Juliet I have 
introduced only two readings not previously found in 
editions of authority ; first, I have placed a comma in 
I. ii. 32 after the words "view of"; secondly, in III. v. 
43 I have inserted the hyphens in "love-lord" and 
" husband-friend." I hope these slight changes may 
commend themselves to some readers ; if the former be 
correct, it solves a long recognised difficulty. I have not 
altered the received punctuation of III. ii. 5-8, although 
I venture to suggest in Appendix III. (" Runaway's 
eyes") a new punctuation, which, as regards lines 5, 6, 
commends itself to me ; the suggestion respecting line 7 
I offer as a mere possibility. I am not so sanguine as to 
expect that readers long familiar with the received text 
will accept my suggestions as to that difficult passage ; 
but how should any critic neglect to add his stone to the 
cairn under which the meaning lies buried? I accept 
Theobald's reading "sun" in I. i. 157, and in so doing 
follow the best modern editors. With some reluctance 
I read in II. i. 13, "Adam Cupid," yielding to the 
authority of Dyce (ed. 2), the Cambridge editors, Furness, 
and others ; and in a note I try to point out possi- 



x INTRODUCTION 

bilities which may justify or lead towards justifying the 
" Abraham " of all the early texts. 

I may add here that if the nickname " Abraham " 
was given to Cupid because he is the " father of many 
nations," an additional comic effect might be gained by 
choosing for Cupid a name recognised as a favourite one 
with Elizabethan Puritans. In Middleton's The Family 
of Love, Dryfat, a member of the " Family," says, " I 
have Aminadabs and Abrahams to my godsons." I 
must leave it to some more ingenious critic to make the 
discovery that we should read " Abron Cupid," and that 
Shakespeare had noticed in Cooper's Thesaurus (1573): 
" Abron, the name of a man, whose sensualitie and 
delicate life is growne to a Proverbe." 

The Quarto editions of Romeo and Jtdiet are the 
following : 

" An Excellent conceited Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet, 
As it hath bene often (with great applause) plaid 
publiquely, by the right Honourable the L. of Hunsdon 
his Servants. London, Printed by lohn Banter. 

1597" (Q i). 

" The Most Excellent and lamentable Tragedie, of 
Romeo and lulict. Newly corrected, augmented, and 
amended : As it hath bene sundry times publiquely 
acted, by the right Honourable the Lord Chamberlaine 
his Servants. London Printed by Thomas Creede, for 
Cuthbert Burby, and are to be sold at his shop neare 
the Exchange. 15 99." This, the second Quarto, I refer 
to as O, unless there is special occasion to distinguish 
it as Q 2. 

The third Quarto (Q 3) was printed in 1609 for 



INTRODUCTION xi 

John Smethwick ; the title-page describes the tragedy 
as having been " sundry times publiquely Acted, by the 
Kings Majesties Servants at the Globe." 

The fourth Quarto (O 4), printed also for John 
Smethwicke, is without date. In some copies the word 
" Globe " is followed by " Written by W. Shake-speare." 
In other copies (said by Halliwell-Phillipps to be the 
later issues) the name of the author does not appear. 

The fifth Quarto (O 5) is dated 1637 ; it was printed 
by " R. Young for John Smethwicke." 

The text of Romeo and Juliet in the first Folio, 1623, 
(F) was derived from Q 3. 

The editors of the Cambridge Shakespeare observe : 
" As usual there are a number of changes, some 
accidental, some deliberate, but all generally for the 
worse, excepting the changes in punctuation and in the 
stage-directions. The punctuation, as a rule, is more 
correct, and the stage-directions are more complete, in 
the Folio." 

The second Quarto 1599 first gives the play in 
full ; it is our best authority for the text ; but the correc- 
tions of the later Quartos and of the Folio are valuable 
aids towards ascertaining the text, while in not a few 
passages Q I lends assistance which cannot elsewhere 
be found. 

In the present edition the readings of Q and of F 
which differ from the editor's text are recorded, except a 
few obvious misprints and such others as seem wholly 
unimportant. Not many references are made to O 3 , 
because in general its various readings passed into the 
text of F, which was derived from that Quarto. For my 



xii INTRODUCTION 

references to Q 5 (which are few) I have trusted to the 
Cambridge Shakespeare and to Furness. 

Q i differs so considerably, and in so many minute 
details, from the received text, that the variations can- 
not be rightly exhibited in notes ; it must be read in 
its entirety, and happily it is easily accessible in the 
facsimile by Praetorius, in Mommsen's reprint, in the 
Cambridge Shakespeare^ in Furness, and (with most 
advantage for the student) in the New Shakspere 
Society's reprint of Parallel Texts of the First Two 
Quartos, admirably edited by Mr. Daniel. Such 
readings as have been adopted from Q I into the text 
of modern editors have a special claim to attention ; 
these I have, with few exceptions, recorded, and have 
added in notes and in Appendix I. several lines and 
passages differing from the received text in a way which 
can hardly be accounted for by errors of the printer or 
reporter. In these, or in some of these, we probably 
find work of Shakespeare discarded in his revision of the 
play. 

The relation of Q I to the later text has been the 
subject of much discussion. I cannot state the results of 
my own study better than by quoting from Mr. Daniel's 
Introduction to the Parallel Texts : " A hasty and 
separate perusal of Q I may leave the reader with the 
impression that it represents an earlier play than that 
given in the subsequent editions ; read line for line with 
Q 2 its true character soon becomes apparent. It is an 
edition made up partly from copies of portions of the 
original play, partly from recollection and from notes 
taken during the performance. Q 2 gives us for the 



INTRODUCTION xiii 

first time a substantially true representation of the 
original play. Still Q I is of great value, as it affords 
the means of correcting many errors which had crept 
into the ' copy ' from which O 2 was printed, and also, 
in its more perfect portions, affords conclusive evidence 
that that ' copy ' undenvent revision, received some slight 
augmentations, and, in some few places, must have been 
entirely rewritten." As evidence of the last statement 
I may refer my reader to Appendix I., to which the 
following may here be added; in III. ii. 5760 Juliet, 
in our received text, speaks : 

O break, my heart ! poor bankrupt, break at once ! 
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty ! 
Vile earth, to earth resign, end motion here, 
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier ! 

These are evidently new lines written to replace those of 
O I, which run thus : 

Ah Romeo, Romeo, what disaster hap 

Hath severd thee from thy true Juliet? 

Ah why should Heaven so much conspire with Woe, 

Or Fate envie our happie Marriage, 

So soone to sunder us by timelesse Death ? 

Shall we conjecture that Shakespeare felt that the sense 
of fatality, though proper to Romeo, was less character- 
istic of the strong-willed Juliet ? 

O i, then, is an imperfect representation, piratically 
issued, of the same play which is given fully and, in 
the main, aright in O 2 ; but before Q 2 appeared 
Shakespeare had revised the play, and had rewritten a 
few passages. The theory of Mr. Grant White that traces 



xiv INTRODUCTION 

of another hand than Shakespeare's may be detected in 
the earlier version of the play is, I think, sufficiently 
refuted by Mr. T. A. Spalding in his paper " On the First 
Quarto of Romeo and Juliet: Is there any evidence of a 
Second Hand in it ? " printed in Transactions of the New 
Shakspere Society, 187779. 

An interesting peculiarity of Q I is found in the stage- 
directions ; they were evidently noted down by a 
spectator in the theatre, perhaps by the shorthand 
writer who probably supplied much of the manuscript. 
They give us pleasant glimpses of the stage-business 
during the original presentation of Romeo and Juliet. In 
the opening scene a stage-direction serves as a substitute 
for the bustling dialogue, which in the clash of swords 
and clubs may have reached the reporter's ears too 
imperfectly to be reported : " They draw, to them enters 
Tybalt, they fight, to them the Prince, old Mountague, 
and his wife, old Capulet and his wife, and other Citizens 
and part them." Later we have the departing guests 
whispering excuses to Capulet " they whisper in his 
eare " ; Mercutio insulting the Nurse's dignity " he 
walkes by them, and sings " ; the Nurse rebuking her 
too passive protector " she turnes to Peter her man " ; 
Juliet entering " somewhat fast " and embracing Romeo ; 
Tybalt thrusting Mercutio under Romeo's arm ; the 
Nurse " wringing her hands, with the ladder of cordes in 
her lap " ; Romeo offering to stab himself, and the 
Nurse snatching the dagger away ; Capulet calling Paris 
again, as he offers to go in, in order that he may make 
the " desperate tender " of Juliet's love ; Juliet kneeling 
to her father, and again looking after the departing Nurse, 



INTRODUCTION xv 

before she breaks forth with the words, " Ancient 
damnation, O most cursed fiend " ; the mourners for 
Juliet all crying out at once, and wringing their hands; 
Countie Paris and his Page bearing flowers and sweet 
water to Juliet's tomb; Friar Laurence, at the entrance 
to the tomb, stooping and looking on the blood and 
weapons. 

The date at which Romeo and Juliet was written 
cannot be certainly determined. The title-page of O i 
describes the tragedy as having been often played 
publicly by the Lord of Ilunsdon's servants. Malone 
ascertained that two Lords Hunsdon, Henry, the father, 
and George, his son, filled the office of Lord Chamberlain 
of the Household to Queen Elizabeth. Henry, the 
father, died July 22, 1596; on his death, Shakespeare's 
company came under the protection of his son, who 
was appointed Lord Chamberlain on April 17, 1597. 
Before July 22, 1596, and after April 1597 the actors 
would be styled the Lord Chamberlain's servants (as 
they are on the title-page of O 2) ; in the interval 
they were the Lord Hunsdon's servants ; and hence 
we may infer that it was during this interval that the 
presentations spoken of on the title-page of Q I took 
place. 

An allusion to the play by John Weever has been 
supposed to carry back the date to 1595. Weever's 
Epigrammes was published in 1599, when the author 
was twenty-three years old ; he tells us that most of the 
epigrams were written when he was only twenty ; he 
attained that age in 1596, and to suppose that his 
reference to Romeo and Juliet is of a date earlier than 



xvi INTRODUCTION 

that year is a gratuitous assumption. An allusion in 
Marston's Scourge of Villanie 

I set thy lips abroach, from whence doth flow 
Naught but pure Juliet and Romeo 

testifies to the popularity of the play, and possibly by 
the mention of " Curtain plaudities " points to the Curtain 
theatre as the place of representation ; but the Scourge 
of Villanie is later in date than the first Quarto of 
Romeo and Juliet. Some lines in The Wisdom of Doctor 
Dodipoll which imitate (or seem to imitate) words of 
Juliet, and some resemblances between Romeo and Juliet 
and Wily Beguiled, when dates are scrutinised (see 
Daniel's edition of Romeo and Juliet, New Sh. Soc. p. 
xxxv), prove equally fallacious in helping us to fix a 
date. 

Turning to the play itself, we find mention of " the 
first and second cause " (il. iv.), which has been regarded, 
on no sufficient grounds, as suggested by Vincentio 
Saviolo his Practise (1594 and 1595). Mr. Fleay has 
noticed that the reference may be to " The Book of Honor 
and Arms, wherein is discussed the causes of quarrel," etc. 
(Stationers' Register, December 13, 1589). There are 
undoubtedly reminiscences in Romeo and Juliet of 
Marlowe's plays. The lines 

But soft ! what light through yonder window breaks ? 
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun ! 

seem to echo Marlowe's lines in The Jew of Malta, II. i. 
41, 42: 

But stay, what star shines yonder in the east ? 
The loadstar of my life, if Abigail. 



INTRODUCTION xvii 

Juliet's age is reduced by Shakespeare from the sixteen 
years of his original (the Romeus and Juliet of Brooke) 
to fourteen. " Death lies on her," exclaims Capulet 

(IV. v.) ( 

like an untimely frost 
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field. 

At the close of Act I. of The Jew of Malta Don Mathias 
describes the Jew's daughter, now entered into a 
convent : 

A fair young maid, scarce fourteen years of age, 
The sweetest flower in Cytherea's field, 
Cropt from the pleasures of the fruitful earth. 1 

Still more striking is the resemblance between the open- 
ing lines of Juliet's soliloquy (ill. ii.), " Gallop apace, 
you fiery footed steeds," etc., and lines in Marlowe's 
Edward II. IV. iii. : 

Gallop apace, bright Phoebus, through the sky, 
And dusky night, in rusty iron car, 
Between you both shorten the time, etc. 

Shakespeare was much influenced by Marlowe in some 
early plays; but Romeo and Juliet is not written in disciple- 
ship to Marlowe, and it must be remembered that in plays 
as late as As You Like It and Troilus and Crcssida 
reminiscences of Marlowe are found. 2 

These echoes from Marlowe have a certain bearing 
on the supposed imitation of lines of Romeo and Juliet, 

1 This interesting parallel has been pointed out to me by Mr. \V. J. 
Craig. 

2 The points in common between Juliet's Nurse and the Nurse in Dido 
Queen of Carthage by Marlowe and Nash seem to me of little importance. 
Shakespeare found his Nurse in Brooke's poem. 



xvlii INTRODUCTION 

V. iii., by Daniel in his Complaint of Rosa mond (i 592). 
The most striking of these resemblances is that of 
Daniel's verses 

And nought-respecting death (the last of paines) 
Plac'd his pale colours (th' ensigne of his might) 
Upon his new-got spoil before his right 

to Shakespeare's 

Thou art not conquer'd ; beauty's ensign yet 
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, 
And death's pale flag is not advanced there. 

Daniel was charged not altogether unfairly with the 
infirmity of plagiarism. But Shakespeare was certainly a 
reader of some of Daniel's poetry ; and if he derived 
suggestions from Marlowe, why may he not have taken 
a hint from Daniel, and vindicated his conveyance by a 
triumphant ennoblement of Daniel's imagery and ex- 
pression ? l 

Far too much insistence, in my opinion, has been 
laid on the Nurse's reference (l. iii.) to the earthquake 
" 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years." An 
allusion may not improbably have been intended to the 
earthquake of 1580 felt in England. But the humour 
of the allusion may lie in the fact that the Nurse, who 
insists on the accuracy of her recollection " Nay, I do 
bear a brain," is really astray in her chronology. Juliet 
is now on the point of being fourteen years of age ; yet 
eleven years previously at three years old she was only 

1 The case is greatly strengthened l>y a comparison of I.ticrciC with 
Daniel's Rosamond. There can here be no doubt that Shakespeare was the 
debtor. See the article, " Shakespeare's Lucrece," by K\vig, in Aii^lia xxii., 
Neue Folge Hand x., Yicrtrs I left. pp. 436-448. 



INTRODUCTION xlx 

about to be weaned, and had barely learnt to " run and 
waddle," with a risk of breaking her brow. The Nurse 
again asseverates that " since that time it is eleven 
years " ; but this making the most of a jest seems 
slender evidence on behalf of the theory that the play 
was produced in the year I59I. 1 

There is no decisive evidence to prove that the 
tragedy was written long before its presentation in i 596, 
when, probably, its popularity called forth a ballad (entry 
in Stationers' Register, August 5) on the subject of Romeo 
and Juliet. Yet most readers, I think, have felt that it 
is a play of Shakespeare's early years of authorship ; the 
lyrical character of the play, though partly accounted for 
by the love-theme, the abundance of rhyme, not only 
in couplets, but alternate, and arranged in sextet and 
sonnet form, the pleasure of the writer in forced conceits, 
and play upon words, sometimes even in serious passages, 
point to an early date. 2 When his judgment had matured 
Shakespeare could not have written so very ill as he 
sometimes does in Romeo and Juliet, but a writer of 
genius could at an early age, when inspired by the 
passion of his theme, have written as admirably as he 
does even in the noblest passages of the fifth Act. That 
he was conscious of having already attained comparative 
mastery in his art may be inferred from his independence 
of Marlowe, and the implied criticism of the style of 



1 If anyone should care to sec a catalogue of earthquakes compiled by a 
contemporary of Shakespeare, he will find one in the Indice to Discorsi del 
S. Allesandro Sardo (Venice, 1586), which volume includes a treatise "Del 
Terremoto."

corresponding to the epithalamium ( Juliet's soliloquy) and to the dawn-song. 



xx INTRODUCTION 

Kyd in the exclamatory lamentations over Juliet sup- 
posed dead. I can hardly doubt that Mr. Spalding is 
right in stating that the line 

O love, O life, not life but love in death, 
and again, 

O child, O child, my soul and not my child, 

are parodies on Hieronimo's words in The Spanish 
Tragedy : 

O eyes ! no eyes, but fountains fraught with tears ; 

O life ! no life, but lively forms in death ; 

O world ! no world, but mass of public wrongs. 

Yet there is something inartificial in introducing such 
irony of literary criticism into the body of the play ; and 
Shakespeare took a better method in his " tedious brief 
scene " of very tragical mirth in A Midsummer Night's 
Dream, and again in yEneas' tale to Dido (where he 
reproduces rather than parodies an earlier style), which 
the player recites before Hamlet. On the whole, we 
might place Romeo and Juliet, on grounds of internal 
evidence, near The Rape of Lucrece ; portions may be 
earlier in date ; certain passages of the revised version 
are certainly later; but I think that 1595 may serve as 
an approximation to a central date, and cannot be very 
far astray. 

The basis, as Malone puts it, upon which Shakespeare 
built his play is the Romeus and Juliet of Arthur Brooke 
or Broke, of which I have given an analysis in Appendix 
II. Brooke's poem, which is a free rehandling in verse of 



INTRODUCTION xxi 

Pierre Boisteau's French version of a novel by Bandcllo, 
was first published in I562. 1 Painter's prose rendering 
in the Palace of Pleasure of Boisteau's story appeared 
some years later. From this last Shakespeare derived, 
if anything, certainly very little ; but how carefully he 
followed Brooke will appear from my analysis, and more 
fully from Mr. Daniel's valuable Introduction to the 
New Shakspere Society's reprint of Brooke's poem and 
Painter's prose. That Shakespeare agrees with Brooke 
where the latter differs from Painter was decisively 
established by Malone : " I. In the poem the Prince of 
Verona is called Escalus ; so also in the play. In 
Painter's translation from Boisteau he is named Signor 
Escala, and sometimes Lord Bartholomew of Escala. 2. 
In Painter's novel the family of Romeo are called the 
Montesches; in the poem and in the play the Montagues. 
3. The messenger employed by Friar Lawrence to carry 
a letter to Romeo is in Painter's translation called 
Anselme; in the poem and in the play Friar John is 
employed in this business. 4. The circumstance of 
Capulet's writing down the names of the guests whom 
he invites to supper is found in the poem and in the play, 
but is not mentioned by Painter, nor is it found in the 
original Italian novel. 5. The residence of the Capulets 
in the original and in Painter is called Villa Franca ; in 
the poem and in the play Freetown? 1 6. Several passages 
of Romeo and Juliet appear to have been formed on hints 

1 In his address "To the Reader" Brooke mentions that he had seen 
"the same argument lately set foorth on stage," with more commendation 
than he can look for. 

- In the play it is the name of the "common judgment-place" of the 
Prince. E. D. 



xxii INTRODUCTION 

furnished by the poem, of which no traces are found 
either in Painter's novel, or in Boisteau, or the original." 

Brooke's poem has been unjustly depreciated ; yet it 
contains no poetry of a high order. If Romeo and Juliet 
owed to Shakespeare, as Mr. Grant White has said, only 
its dramatic form and poetic decoration, we might still 
add with the critic This is to say that " the earth owes 
to the sun only its verdure and flowers, the air only its 
perfume and its balm, the heavens only their azure and 
their glow." But in fact Shakespeare departs from 
Brooke, as Mr. White proceeds to point out, in several 
important particulars. He accelerates the action, reducing 
the time from months to days, and thus adds impetuosity 
to the torrent of passion. He creates from a mere passing 
hint of Brooke the brilliant and gallant Mercutio. In 
Brooke's poem Mercutio appears but once for a moment, 
as a courtier in the ballroom of Capulet ; he is " courteous 
of his speech " and " pleasant of device " ; bold among 
the bashful maids as a lion among lambs ; and nature 
has given him the gift of hands that are colder than 
frozen mountain ice. But he does not serve, as with 
Shakespeare, by his vivid intellectuality to set off the 
imaginative passion of Romeo ; he is not at once the 
irrepressible mocker and the chivalrous protector ; nor 
does he die, still jesting and still gallant, before the 
tragedy darkens to its close. Shakespeare, again, it is 
who introduces Tybalt at the old accustomed feast of 
Capulet, and thus, incarnating in an individual the rage 
of faction, brings hatred face to face with love. The 
character of the Nurse is found in Brooke, but Shakespeare 
admirably develops its humorous side. He reduces the 



INTRODUCTION xxiii 

age of Juliet from sixteen to fourteen, the age of 
Marlowe's Abigail, so heightening the miracle of love, 
which transforms her from a child to a heroic woman. 
Me deepens her solitude by depriving Lady Capulet of a 
mother's tenderness, and showing her as a somewhat 
unsympathetic woman of the world. And he brings 
the lord-lover Paris, " a man of wax," to the church- 
yard, with his flowers and perfumed water, to die, 
and to illustrate the gentleness, the resolution, and the 
magnanimity of Romeo. 

The Romeo and Juliet legend has a long history, 
and it is not necessary here to trace it in detail. 1 
Almost at the moment when Shakespeare was writing 
his tragedy the Italian Girolamo de la Corte published 
his History of Verona (1594-96), and there recorded as 
matter of historical fact the story of the star-crossed 
lovers. He assigns the events to the year 1303, when 
Verona was ruled by Bartolomeo de la Scala. But 
imaginary history seems to have grown out of legend, 
and modern criticism has disenchanted the " Sepolcro 
di Giulietta e Romeo " at Verona. One of the incidents 
of the story the escape from enforced marriage by 
the use of a sleeping potion is as old as Xenophon 
of Ephesus, whose romance of the loves of Anthia 
and Abrocomas was first printed from the only ex- 
isting manuscript in 1726.- A tale of much more

and Painter, and my article on "Romeo and Juliet" in Transcripts and

xxiv INTRODUCTION 

recent date, that among the novelle of Massuccio of 
Salerno (1476), which narrates the loves of Mariotto 
Mignanelli and Giannozza Saraceni of Siena, has a 
sufficient number of points of resemblance to Romeo and 
Juliet to warrant our placing it in the genealogy of the 
drama. The lovers are secretly married by a Friar ; 
Mariotto quarrels with a citizen of note, strikes him a 
fatal blow with a stick, is exiled, and flies from Siena to 
Alexandria. The father of Giannozza urges her to mar- 
riage with a suitor of his choice ; she resolves to feign 
herself dead, and the Friar provides the sleeping potion ; 
she is buried in the church of St. Augustine ; is delivered 
from the tomb by the Friar, and sails for Alexandria 
disguised as a monk. The messenger whom she had 
despatched with letters to her husband is captured by 
pirates ; Mariotto hears of her death ; in the garb of a 
pilgrim visits her tomb, which he attempts to open ; is 
seized, condemned, and beheaded. Giannozza returns 
from Alexandria to Siena, and in a convent the broken- 
hearted wife dies. 

Some fifty years after the publication of Massuccio's 
tale Luigi Da Porto wrote his Istoria novellamente 
ritrovata di due nobili Amanti, and here the scene is 
Verona, and the lovers are named Romeo and Giulietta. 

the portion which has some resemblance to the story of Juliet will be found 
in pp. 124-139. In the anonymous play, How a Man may choose a Good 
Wife from a Bad (1602), which is founded on a novel (Decade III., Novella 
v.) of Cinthio's Hecatommithi, the incidents of an opiate given for poison to 
a young wife by her faithless husband, her burial, and revival in the coffin, are 
turned to comic uses. It is perhaps worth noting that here, as in Romeo and 
Juliet, the sale of poisons is spoken of as illegal : 

some covetous slave for coyne, 
Will sell it him, though it be held by law, 
To be no better than flat fellony. 



INTRODUCTION xxv 

Da Porto's novel was published posthumously at Venice 
without date, about the year 1530. It is substantially 
the story familiar to us, 1 but there are variations in 
detail, and certain personages of the drama are wanting. 
Romeo masks not as a pilgrim but as a nymph ; the 
lovers touch hands and whisper their passion in the 
torch-dance ; the wooing and winning are not swiftly 
accomplished ; the sentence of banishment is not 
pronounced until after some happy bridal days and 
nights have followed the secret marriage ; the nurse has 
not yet appeared in the story ; for Paris we have here 
the Count of Lodrone ; Juliet awakens from her drugged 
sleep in the tomb before the poison has quite overcrowed 
the spirit of her husband, and a dialogue ensues, the 
motive of which has been idealised and exalted in the 
opera of Gounod. This form of the tragic scene was 
unknown to Shakespeare, who could have conveyed 
into it the beauty and dignity of passion ; when Otway, 
and subsequently Garrick, with Otway as his guide, 
varied from the Shakespearian close, they struck false 
notes and fell into the phrases of convention and pseudo- 
pathos. 2 

Adrian Sevin's French transformation of the story of 
Romeo and Juliet into the story of Halquadrich and 
Burglipha (1542) has little interest, and does not take a 
place in the direct line of the development of the tale

The Original Story of Komco and Jiti'i,:?, by G. Pace-Sanfelice, 1868. Mr.

passages : Juliet and ROIHC.O, Boston, 1895. l' or short accounts, sec Daniel

from Da Porto to Shakespeare. Nor does there appear 
to be, except through a certain influence exercised on 
Bandello, any real connection between Shakespeare's 
tragedy and the poem in ottava rima published at 
Venice in 1553, possibly the work of Gherardo Bolderi 
assuming the name of Clitia or Clizia. It will be found 
in Torri's volume already mentioned. Mr. Daniel points 
out certain variations from Da Porto, of which the most 
interesting is that here for the first time Tebaldo's death 
is supposed by Lady Capulet to be the cause of Juliet's 
grief. An attempt was made by J. C. Walker, in his 
Historical Memoir on Italian Tragedy, 1799 (pp. 49-64), 
to show that Shakespeare had utilised to some extent as 
a source the Hadriana, a tragedy of the year 1578, by 
the blind poet Luigi Groto. The loves of Latino and 
Hadriana are unquestionably derived in part from the 
loves of Da Porto's Romeo and Giulietta ; but Mr. Daniel, 
who gives a complete analysis of the play, is right in 
saying that the resemblances between La Hadriana and 
Shakespeare's tragedy are rather to be sought in special 
passages than in the general conduct of the two plays. 
Following Walker and Lloyd, and adding to their 
enumeration, he notices the song of the nightingale 
when the lovers part, the description of the effects of the 
opiate, the consolation offered to the father on the 
supposed death of his daughter, and other seeming 
points of contact ; yet, although Groto was known 
in England in Shakespeare's time, Mr. Daniel's con- 
clusion is expressed in the words : " Notwithstand- 
ing these resemblances, I find it difficult to believe 
that Shakespeare could have made use of Groto's 



INTRODUCTION xxvii 

play" a conclusion with which I am in entire 
agreement. 

Bandello's novel, of which Boisteau's is a translation, 
stands of course in the direct line of the ancestry of 
Ronico and Juliet. It appeared among his novclle 
published at Lucca in 1554. Referring the reader to 
Mr. Daniel's more detailed account of the points in 
common between Bandello and Shakespeare, I may 
quote what I have elsewhere written : " Bandello dwells 
on Romeo's amorous fancy for a hard-hearted mistress 
Shakespeare's Rosaline to which Da Porto only alludes. 
An elder friend Shakespeare's Benvolio advises the 
enamoured youth to ' examine other beauties,' and to 
subdue his passion. Romeo enters Capulet's mansion 
disguised, but no longer as a nymph. The Count of 
Lodrone is now first known as Paris. The ladder of 
ropes is now first mentioned. The sleeping potion is 
taken by Juliet, not in presence of her chamber-maid 
and aunt, but in solitude. Friar Lorenzo's messenger to 
Mantua fails to deliver the letter because he is detained 
in a house suspected of being stricken with plague. In 
particular we owe to Bandello the figure of the nurse, 
not Shakespeare's humorous creation, but a friendly old 
woman, who very willingly plays her part of go-between 
for the lovers. One more development and all the 
materials of Shakespeare's play are in full formation. 
From Bandello's mention of one Spolentino of Mantua, 
from whom Romeo procures the poison, Pierre Boisteau 
creates the episode of the Apothecary, and it is also to 
this French refashioner of the story that we must trace 
the Shakespearian close; with him, Juliet does not wake 



xxviii INTRODUCTION 

from her sleep until Romeo has ceased to breathe ; and 
she dies, as in our tragedy, not in a paroxysm of 
grief, but by her own hand, armed with her husband's 
dagger." * 

The Quartos and Folios do not divide Romeo and 
Juliet into acts and scenes. Mr. Daniel suggests that 
Act III. should end with scene iv., making Act IV. begin 
with the parting of the lovers. " The interposition," he 
writes, " of the short scene iv. alone, between the arrange- 
ment made at the Friar's Cell for the meeting of the 
lovers and the scene in which they part, does not give a 
sufficiently marked interval for the occurrence of all the 
events which are supposed to have passed in the in- 
terim : moreover the addition of scene v. to Act III. has 
the disadvantage of making that act inordinately long. 
Capell made the division I here suggest ; but his example 
does not appear to have been followed by any subsequent 
editor." The suggestion seems to me well worthy of 
consideration, and I may call attention to the fact that 
in O i the first of those ornamental dividing marks which 
appear on several of the later pages occurs at this point. 
The same ornamental division occurs in the scene of the 
lovers' parting at the entrance of Juliet's mother, and, 
I think, it was intended that there should here be a 
change of scene. It appears again at the close of our 
present Act in., at the close of iv. i., the close of iv. ii., 

1 Transcripts and Studies, pp. 389-390. To the study from which I 
quote I may refer the reader for an account of Lope dc Vega's Castehrines 
y Monteses and of Los Bandos dc Verona, by Francisco dc Rojas y 
Zorrilla (both of which may be read in privately printed translations by .Mr. 
F. W. Cosens). The strange conjunction of Shakespeare's lovers with 
Dante's Ugolino in the Romeo el Juliette of Ducis is also noticed in the 
same study. 



INTRODUCTION xxix 

the close of IV. iii., the close of iv. iv., the close of v. i., 
the close of v. ii., in v. iii. immediately before the entrance 
of the Friar, and again immediately after Juliet's death. 
The use of the mark is evidently not accidental or 
careless. 

The dramatic time is carefully noted throughout the 
play, but presents one inexplicable difficulty. The action 
opens early on Sunday morning; after the street fray 
when Romeo and Benvolio meet, it has but " new struck 
nine." The afternoon has come when Romeo reads the 
list of Capulet's invited guests ; at night the " old accus- 
tomed feast " is held, and Romeo after the feast hears 
Juliet's confession of love at the window. Early on 
Monday morning Romeo visits Friar Laurence ; at noon 
he jests with Mercutio, and informs Juliet through the 
Nurse that the marriage shall be celebrated that after- 
noon. The lovers arc married ; the encounter with 
Tybalt, " that an hour hath been my cousin," follows. 
The sentence of banishment is pronounced ; but it is 
arranged that the new husband and wife shall spend 
their bridal night together. At dawn on Tuesday morn- 
ing Romeo parts from Juliet. Capulet on the preceding 
night had fixed the marriage with Paris for Thursday ; 
he now rages and threatens Juliet; she visits the Friar, 
who gives her the sleeping potion ; she returns, seems to 
acquiesce in her parents' wishes, and the hasty Capulet 
resolves that she shall be taken at her word, and married 
to Paris to - morrow (Wednesday) morning. At some 
hour of the night of Tuesday Juliet drinks the potion. 
Old Capulet bustles during the night in preparations 
for the wedding " the curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three 



xxx INTRODUCTION 

o'clock." On Wednesday morning Juliet is found in 
seeming death ; the Friar arrives at the hour prefixed 
for marriage ; all is turned from a wedding to a funeral ; 
Juliet is laid in the tomb of her ancestors. At a later 
hour of what seems to be the same day (Wednesday), 
Balthasar informs Romeo of his wife's death ; Romeo 
obtains the poison, sets out for Verona, at night enters 
the monument by torch- light, and dies beside his beloved. 
Friar Laurence " at the prefixed hour of her waking " 
arrives to take Juliet from the vault ; she stabs herself 
and dies ; the Prince, called from his morning's rest, 
enters, and on Thursday at an early hour the action 
closes. 1 

The rapidity of the whole conduct of the action is 
surprising ; yet, up to the night on which Juliet swallows 
the Friar's potion, there can be no question as to the 
dating of days and hours. At this point Shakespeare 
creates a difficulty that seems to be insuperable. He 
had probably noticed in Painter's version of the tale a 
statement of the Friar that the opiate effects of the drug 
were to continue for " the space of forty hours at the 
least." As if to be more precise Shakespeare names the 
period as " two and forty hours." From what time of 
the night of Tuesday will forty-two succeeding hours 
bring us to a very early morning hour (the month is 
July) of either Thursday or Friday? The period is too 
short to suit Friday morning, too long for Thursday. 
We should not trouble ourselves about what might be 



1 See, together with Daniel's " Time- Analysis of the Plots of Shake- 
speare's Plays" (New Sh. Society s Transactions, 1879), the notes on p. 202 
and p. 219 of Mr. Rolfe's edition of Romeo and Juliet. 



INTRODUCTION xxxi 

explained as a mere stage-illusion of time, if Shakespeare 
had required such a stage-illusion, or if he had not elated 
the events throughout with more exactness than the 
stage requires. In Painter the Friar directs Juliet to 
drink the potion " the night before your marriage or in 
the morning before day " ; in Brooke, " on thy marriage 
day before the sun do clear the sky." Can Shakespeare 
at one time have intended that Juliet's soliloquy should 
represent the passions of a whole night, and that she 
should not swallow the opiate until a short time before 
the Nurse came to rouse her in order that she should 
prepare for the marriage ceremony ? And was she to 
return to consciousness in the first glimmering of a July 
dawn, as soon after midnight as that might be, on the 
morning of Friday ? The theory is in many ways un- 
satisfactory, but the mere passage of hours during a 
soliloquy need not present a difficulty to the student 
of Shakespeare. In Cymbeline it is midnight when 
Imogen is seized by sleep ; lachimo comes from the 
trunk, soliloquises, and the clock strikes three. Yet it 
can hardly be supposed that Shakespeare ever intended 
that Juliet should conjure up the vision of the slaughtered 
Tybalt in the full light of morning. Perhaps the simplest 
explanation of the difficulty is to admit that it was never 
meant to be explained ; forty-two hours gave an air of 
precision and verisimilitude to the Friar's arrangement ; 
it sufficed to cover two periods of night preceding two 
Italian summer dawns ; and the dramatist knew that 
spectators in the theatre do not regulate their imagination 
by a chronometer. 

Unlike the play of Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet has 



xxxii INTRODUCTION 

little of imaginative mystery. The chief subject of 
difference among its critics concerns what we may call 
the ethics of the play. 1 " By Friar Laurence," writes 
Gervinus, " who, as it were, represents the part of the 
chorus in this tragedy, the leading idea of the piece is 
expressed in all fulness, an idea that runs throughout the 
whole, that excess in any enjoyment, however pure in 
itself, transforms its sweet into bitterness, that devotion 
to any single feeling, however noble, bespeaks its ascend- 
ency ; that this ascendency moves the man and woman 
out of their natural spheres ; that love can only be a 
companion in life, and cannot fill out the life and business 
of the man especially ; that in the full power of its first 
rising, it is a paroxysm of happiness, which, according to 
its nature, cannot continue in equal strength ; that, as 
the poet says in an image, it is a flower that, 

' Being smelt, with that part cheers each part ; 
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart."' 

And the critic pursues his well-meant moralisings in the 
same spirit. 

Much nearer the mark was Goethe in his arrange- 
ment of Romeo and Jiiliet for the Weimar theatre, 
i Si i: "Before Juliet revives," in Goethe's recast, " the 
Friar confesses that all his cunning wisdom was in vain ; 
that if he had opposed, instead of aiding the lovers, 
things could not have come to a worse end. After 

1 The commonplace moralisings and the vigorous Protestant feeling 
expressed by Brooke in his address "To the Reader," prefixed to Ronieiis 
and Juliet, did not influence Shakespeare ; and they do not enter into P>rooke's 
poem, where the hero and heroine are not represented as " thralling them- 
selves to unhonest desire," and the "superstitious frier" appears as an 
amiable old student of natural science. 



INTRODUCTION xxxiii 

Juliet has stabbed herself Friar Laurence acknowledges 
the folly that often attends the wisdom of the wise, that 
to attempt to do good is often more dangerous than to 
undertake to do evil. Happy those whose love is pure, 
because both love and hatred lead but to the grave." l 

That is to say, the amiable critic of life as seen from 
the cloister does not understand life or hate or love ; he 
is not the chorus of the tragedy, but an actor whose 
wisdom is of a kind which may easily lead himself and 
others astray. Garrick was not an eminent moralist, 
but there is more of truth in the Prince's rhymed tag, 
with which Garrick's version of the tragedy concludes, 
than can be found in the ponderous moralities of 
Gervinus : 

Well may you mourn my Lords, (now wise too late;> 
These tragic issues of your mutual hate : 
From private feuds, what dire misfortunes flow ; 
Whate'er the cause, the sure effect is Woe. 

The tragic issues are the results not of love, but of love 
growing on the hatred of the houses. Shakespeare has 
set forth this in the opening scene, half humorous yet 
wholly tragic. He reiterates his statement of the fact 
at the close. Romeo and Juliet die as sacrifices to 
appease the insane fury, out of which their lives had 
risen and in which they had no individual part ; therefore 
shall their statues be raised, and in " pure gold " : 

Mon. There shall no figure at such rate be set 

As that of true and faithful Juliet. 
Cap. As rich shall Romeo by his lady lie ; 

Poor sacrifices of our enmity ! 

1 Furness, Koinio anil /ulict, p. 445. 



xxxiv INTRODUCTION 

And thus the dead lovers have become immortal 
victors. 

Shakespeare did not intend to represent more than 
a fragment of human life in the tragedy. He did not 
aim at a criticism of the whole of human character ; 
he cared to show us his hero and his heroine only as 
lovers, and as exemplary in the perfection of their love ; 
faithful even unto death ; choosing, with a final election 
of the heart, love at all costs. Here is no view of the 
whole of life ; we are shown merely what befell a young 
pair of lovers during four days long ago in Verona. But 
Shakespeare felt, and we all feel, that if such love as 
theirs can be taken up into a complete character, modified 
and controlled by the other noble qualities which go to 
form a large and generous nature, the world will be the 
better for such pure and sacred passion. Such, it appears 
to me, are the ethics of the play. 

And the personages by whom the lovers are encircled 
are so conceived as to become the critics of ideal love 
from their several points of view, honouring and exalting 
it by the inadequacy of their criticism. To old Capulet, 
in his mood, it seems that the passions of the heart are 
to be determined by parental authority. To Lady 
Capulet marriage is an affair of worldly convenience. 
To the Nurse it is the satisfaction of a pleasurable 
instinct. Mercutio, a gallant friend, is too brilliant in 
his intellectuality to be capable of a passion in which the 
heart shows that it is superior to the brain ; he mocks 
at love, not because he really scorns it, but because 
he is remote from it, and cherishes before all else his 
free-lance liberty. The Friar views human passion from 



INTRODUCTION xxxv 

the quietudes of the cloister, or from amid the morning 
dew of the fields ; but botany is not the science of 
human life. Even Romeo's earlier self, with his amorous 
melancholy, becomes the critic of his later self, when 
a true and final election has been made, and when love 
has become the risen sun of his day. As for Juliet, 
her words 

My bounty is as boundless as the sea, 
My love as deep ; the more I give to thee, 
The more I have, for both are infinite, 

may serve for an inscription beneath that statue of 
pure gold of which Shakespeare was the artist. 

It may interest some readers to have before them 
the dialogue, in the eighteenth-century taste, of Romeo 
and Juliet in the tomb, as it reached our ancestors, 
somewhat modish ancestors perhaps, and drew forth 
their tears, in the version of Garrick. 

Rom. Soft she breathes, and stirs ! [Juliet wakes. 

Jit!. Where am I ? defend me powers ! 

Rom. She speaks, she lives : and we shall still be bless'd 
My kind propitious stars o'er pay me now 
For all my sorrows past rise, rise, my Juliet, 
And from this cave of death, this house of horror, 
Quick let me snatch thee to thy Romeo's arms, 
There breathe a vital spirit in thy lips, 
And call thee back to life and love. \_Takes Jicr hand. 

Jitl. Bless me! how cold it is! who's there! 

Rom. Thy husband, 

: Tis thy Romeo, Juliet ; rais'd from despair 

To joys unutt'rable ! quit, quit this place, 

And let us fly together \_Brings Jicr from tlic tomb. 

Jill. Why do you force me so I '11 ne'er consent 

My strength may fail me, but my will 's unmov'd, 
I '11 not wed Paris, Romeo is my husband 

Rom. Her senses are unsettled Heav'n restore 'em !

Romeo is thy husband ; I am that Romeo, 
Nor all the opposing pow'rs of earth or man, 
Shall break our bonds, or tear thee from my heart. 

JuL I know that voice Its magic sweetness wakes

\Going to embrace him. 

Dost thou avoid me, Romeo ? let me touch 
Thy hand, and taste the cordial of thy lips 
You fright me speak Oh let me hear some voice 
Besides my own in this drear vault of death, 
Or I shall faint support me 

Rom. Oh I cannot, 

I have no strength, but want thy feeble aid. 
Cruel poison ! 

JuL Poison ! what means my lord ; thy trembling voice ! 
Pale lips! and swimming eyes! death's in thy face! 

Rom. It is indeed I struggle with him now 

The transports that I felt to hear thee speak, 
And see thy op'ning eyes, stopt for a moment 
His impetuous course, and all my mind 
Was happiness and thee ; but now the poison 
Rushes thro' my veins I 'vc not time to tell 
Fate brought me to this place to take a last, 
Last farewel of my love, and with thee die. 

Jul. Die ? was the Friar false ! 

Rom. I know not that 

I thought thee dead : distracted at the sight, 
(Fatal speed) drank poison, kiss'd thy cold lips, 
And found within thy arms a precious grave 
But in that moment Oh 

Jul. And did I wake for this '. 

Rom. My powers arc blasted, 

'Twixt death and love I'm torn- I am distracted! 
But death's strongest and must I leave thee Juliet! 
Oh cruel cursed fate ! in sight of heav'n 

Jul. Thou rav'st lean on my breast

Pull not our heart-strings thus they crack they break 
Oh Juliet! Juliet! [Dies.

A moment stay ; fate marries us in death, 
And we are one no pow'r shall part us.

It is wonderful what a good situation and a great 
actor can do upon the stage, even with words such as 
these. Perhaps all of us who are capable of tears 
would have moistened kerchiefs in presence of the dying 
woes of Mr. Garrick, or Mr. Barry and Mrs. Gibber. 

I have come upon some illustrations of the text, in 
my recent reading, too late for embodiment in my notes ; 
a few of these may be here set down. 

I. i. 79 : Give me my long sivord. Gompare Sharpham, 
The Fleire: "the gentleman that wore the long Sword, 
now weares the short Hanger." 

T. ii. 25 : Earth-treading stars. Adopted by Sharpham, 
Cupid's Whirligig (opening scene) : " the Court, where so 
many Earth-treading starres adornes the Skye of State." 

I. v. 69 : He bears him like a portly gentleman. So 
Middleton, Your Five Gallants, iv. viii. : " That one so 
fortunate amongst us five Shall bear himself more portly" 

I. v. 122: the sport is at t/ic best. Compare Chapman, 
The Gentleman Usher (Pearson's reprint, i. 260): "Our 
hunting sport is at the best." 

II. i. 10: Ay me. This is the "sigh" of line 8, as 
"love" and "dove "are the rhyme. Compare Sharpham, 
The Fleire: "Pis. ay me! A r an. Faith my Lord you '1 
nere win a woman by sighing." 

II. i. 38 : et cetera. So used for an unbecoming omitted 
word by William Haughton in Englishmen for my Money. 



xxxviii INTRODUCTION 

II. iv. 109: Here's goodly gear! So Chapman, An 
humerous dayes mirth (Pearson's reprint, i. 76) : " But here 
is goodly geare." 

II. v. 42 : body, etc. Compare Middleton (ed. Bullen), 
vol. i. 27, and iii. 98. 

in. i. 8: operation of the second cup. So Sharpham, 
The Fleire : " the operation of the pot makes him not able 
to stand." 

in. iii. 57 : Hang up philosophy ! Was this proverbial ? 
Compare W. Haughton, Englishmen for my Money (near 
opening of play) : " Hang up Philosophy, He none of it." 

III. v. 9: Night's candles are burnt out. So Haughton, 
Englishmen, etc. : 

Night's Candles burne obscure, and the pale Moone 
Favouring our drift, lyes buried in a Cloud. 

iv. iv. ii: mouse-hunt. Add, in support of Dyce's 
explanation, Haughton, Englishmen, etc. (spoken of an 
amorous old man) : " Here 's an old Ferret Pole-cat." 

iv. v. 97 : alt, put tip, put up. So Chapman, The 
Gentleman Usher (Pearson's reprint, i. 355): " Umvorthic 
Lord, put up," i.e. cease. 

The references to other plays of Shakespeare than 
Romeo and Juliet are to act, scene, line, as found in the 
Globe Shakespeare. 

I have had a great advantage in preparing this edition 
of Romeo and Juliet in having been preceded by Mr. 
Daniel, the most conscientious and scholarly of editors. 
I have to thank him for an unpublished note on I. iii. 
33. Professor Littledale communicated to me some 
valuable suggestions. Dr. Furnivall called my attention 



INTRODUCTION xxxix 

to the passage of Masson's Milton quoted on p. 82. 
But my chief debt is to my friend Mr. W. J. Craig, who, 
out of the great store of illustrations of Shakespeare 
which during many years he has accumulated, generously 
furnished me with a wealth of quotations which I have 
utilised as far as my space permitted. Whatever value 
this edition may possess is in large measure due to his 
learning and his kindness.

This night you shall behold him at our feast : 80

And find delight writ there with beauty's pen ; 

Examine every married lineament, 

And see how one another lends content ; 

And what obscured in this fair volume lies 85 

Find written in the margent of his eyes. 

This precious book of love, this unbound lover, 

To beautify him, only lacks a cover : 

The fish lives in the sea ; and 'tis much pride 

For fair without the fair within to hide : 90 

That book in many's eyes doth share the glory, 



83. married] O (alone), sevcrall F. 
Q (alone). 

83. married} The word as used here 
for mutually dependent is illustrated 
by the "well-tuned sounds I5y unions

has the authority of all texts except Q. 

84. content} Perhaps with a play (in 
contents of a volume, though else- 
where in Shakespeare only the plural 
contents is used for what is contained. 

85. obscured} Allen suggests obscure. 

86. viargenf} Obscurities were often 
explained in old books in the margin. 
Compare Hamlet, \. ii. 162. Malone 
quotes a close parallel : Lucrece, 99- 
102 : 

" But she, that never coped with 

stranger eyes, 
Could pick no meaning from their 

parling looks, 

Nor read the subtle-shining sec- 
recies 
Writ in the glassy margents of 

such books." 

So Dekker, Honest Whore (Pearson's 
Pekker, ii. p. 136) : "I read Strange 
comments in those margines of your 
lookes." 

87. unbound} unattached (ofa lover) ; 
without binding (ofa book). 



90. fair within'] F, faire, within 



88. cover] Mason suggests a play 
onfenime couverte, a married woman. 
That which binds a lover is a wife, 
and as the lover here is an unbound 
book, a wife corresponds to the binding 
or cover of the book. The present 
passage is the earliest cited in New 
Eng. Diet, for cover of a book. 

89. The fish] Farmer supposed there 
was an allusion here to fish-skin used 
for binding books, a far-fetched notion. 
Lady Capulet, I think, interrupts her 
metaphor of a book to say Lovers are 
at large, like fishes in the sea, but ready 
to be hooked. For the metaphor of 
lover as a fish, see Chorus preceding 
Act n. 8, Much Ado, II. iii. 114, 
and in. i. 26-29, Ant. and Cleop. 
n. v. 10-15. This parenthetical 
metaphor occurs after the description 
of Paris ; then the main metaphor pro- 
ceeds, in a second part, with Juliet 
(the book-cover) for its theme. Mason 
proposes shell for sea, the purport 
of what follows being, he thinks, 
to show the advantage of having a 
handsome person to cover a virtuous 
mind.

says that brows in Middle English 
always means eye-brows ; beetle-browed 
is as old as Langland, Piers Plough- 
man, 1362. The origin favoured by 
New ng. Diet, is a comparison 
with the tufted antennaj of certain 
kinds of beetles. Shakespeare seems 
to have invented the verb beetle used 
in Hamlet, I. iv. 71 : "The cliff that 
beetles o'er his base," that is, a cliff 
like an overhanging forehead. Cot- 
grave, however (1611), has "Beetle- 
browed, soureilleux, '' and he explains 
sourdlleujc as ' ' having very great 
eye -brows." 

35, 36.] Steevens notes Middleton's 
echo of these lines in Blurt Master- 
Constable, 1602 : 



" bid him, whose heart no sorrow 

feels, 
Tickle the rushes with his wanton 

heels, 
I have too much lead at mine.'' 

36. rushes] Steevens notes that not 
only were rooms strewn with rushes, 
but the stage was also so strewn.

line 39 seems to mean I give over the 
game. 

40. (///;/ 's the mouse'] This phrase 
occurs in several Elizabethan dramas, 
sometimes with quibbles on done. 
M alone took it to mean Pcaee ; be still ! 
and hence he supposed it is the con-

Dun is in the mire, spoken of by 
Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, Manciple s

Giffbrd when a boy, is an old Christ- 
mas game, in which a heavy log (the 
horse Dun) is brought into the room, 
is supposed to stick in the mire, and is 
extricated by the players. References

42. Or, save your reverence, love] 
Many editors prefer, from Q i, Of

Hawes' poem Graunde Amour and La 
Belle PuceUc, xxiv. (ed. 1554), the 
five wits are common wit, imagina- 
tion, fantasy, estimation [judgment],

Q I has " Ben. Queene Mab whats

pretext for Mercutio's long descrip- 
tion ; but Q I continues to Benvolio 
the speech of Mercutio. 

53. Queen Mab"} Thorn ( ' 'Three Note- 
lets on Sh.") states that no earlier men- 
tion of Mab than the above is known ; 
that no doubt Shakespeare got the name 
from folk-lore of his own time ; that 
Mab in Welsh means an infant ; and 
that Beaufort, in his Ancient Topo- 
graphy of Ireland, mentions Mabh 
as the chief of the Irish fairies. 
Drayton, with Shakespeare's descrip- 
tion before him, writes, in his 
happiest manner, of Queen Mab in 
Nymphidia the Court of Fayric. 
Attempts have been made to identify 
Queen Mab with Dame Abunde or 
Habunde ; and again with the Irish 
Queen Maeve. Sir H. Ellis says that 
in Warwickshire "Mab-led" (pro- 
nounced Mob-led) signifies led astray 



by a Will-o'-the- Wisp (Brand, Popular 
Antiquities, iii. p. 218, ed. 1841). 

54. fairies' midwife} Warburton 
conjectured and Theobald read 
Fancy's midwife. Warton conjec- 
tured fairy midwife. Steevens ex- 
plains : the person among the fairies 
who delivers the fancies of dreamers, 
the " children of an idle brain '" (line 
97). T. Warton suggests that Mab 
is a midwife because she steals infants 
(leaving changelings) for the fairies. 

55. shape"} Nicholson suggests slate, 
meaning dignity, pomp. See line 70. 

55. agate-stone} That is, the diminu- 
tive figures cut in agate and set in 
rings. So 2 Henry IV. \. ii. 19. 
(Falstaff of his little Page) : " I was 
never manned \\ith an agate til! now.'' 
Glapthorne, in Wit is a Constable, 
1639, speaks of an alderman's thumb- 
ring. Q I reads, for alderman, 
burgomaster. 

57. atomies'} tiny beings, pigmies. 
A'tTi' Eng. Diet, quotes P. Wood- 
house, Flea, 1605, " If with this atomye 
I should contend." Q I has Aitomi,

Rowc's couple, adopted by many

13. Adam Cupid] Upton's con- 
jecture Adam (easily misread Abram} 
is generally accepted, the allusion 
being to the great archer, Adam Bell, 
famous in ballad poetry. Compare 
Much Ado, I. i. 260: "shoot at 
me ; and he that hits me let him be 
clapped on the shoulder, and called 
Adam.'''' The Abraham of Q I, Qq, Ff 
may be right. If the source of the 
Cophetua ballad were found, which 
may lurk in some old book on Africa, 
a bowman named Abraham might be 
discovered. An Ethiopian king (448- 
470) was so named. If "young 
Abraham " is named after the patri- 
arch, the nickname must mean 
"father of many nations"' (Genesis 
xvii. 5), not wholly inappropriate to 
Cupid. Knight supposed that cheat 
was meant, the allusion being to the 
Abraham-men of Elizabethan days 
vagabonds, bare - armed and bare - 
legged, pretending madness. In S. 
Rowlands' Martin Mark-all (about 
1609), he gives Abram as a slang 
word meaning mad. In Street 
Kobberies consider' a (about 1700) 
Abram is given as a cant word for 
naked, which would suit Cupid well, 



but, though clearly a relic of the 
Abraham-men, I have found no earlier 
example in this sense. Again, as 
Theobald observed, abraham and 
abram are old spellings of auburn 
(e.g. Coriolanus, II. iii. 21, F text); 
many examples might be cited. 
Italian poets name Cupid "II biondo 
Dio," and \V. Thomas, Principal 
Rules of the Italian Grammer, 1567, 
explains biondo, as "the aberne 
(auburn) colour, that is betwene white 
and yelow." "White reads " auburn 1 ' 
here. Finally, the nickname may be 
an allusion to some forgotten Eliza- 
bethan contemporary, whose name 
(such, for example, as S[ir] Abra\]iani\ 
/^Krnnan, who wrote verses in the 
British Museum copy of Nash's Jack 
ll'i/.'oit) or whose fame in archery 
invited a jest. 

13. /rim] The trim of Q i pre- 
serves a word of the ballad "King 
Cophetua and the Beggar Maid," 
given in Percy's Keliques : "The 
blinded boy that shoots so trim." In 
Love's Lahour's Lost, I. ii. 117. the 
ballad is spoken of as written "some 
three ages since."

that stand idelye in the face of a

however, that grey in Elizabethan 
literature (and I think in a few 
passages of Shakespeare) means 
sometimes bluish. Cotgrave has 
" Rluard, gray, skie coloured,

Cooper, Thesaurus (1573): "Gray, 
skie colour with speckes of gray,

says Cooper, "is commonly taken 
for blewe or gray like the skie with 
speckes as Ciesiiis is, but I thinke it 
rather reddie, " etc. Unless we 
understand grey as bluish, Shake- 
speare nowhere speaks of blue eyes

154. "lady . . . lady' : ] from the 
ballad of Susanna, quoted in Twelfth 
Night, II. iii. 85. Perhaps part of the 
mockery lies in bringing the Nurse into 
relation with the "woman fair and 
virtuous, Lady, lady " of the ballad. 
See "a goodly lady, O lady, lady" in 
The Rare Triumphs of Love and 
Fortune (1589), llazlitt's Dodsley's 
Old Plays, vi. p. 198. 

156. saucy merchant] impudent 
fellow ; merchant is used like chap, 
a shortened form of chapman. 
Steevens quotes Churchyard's Chance, 
1580: ' ; What sausie merchaunt speak - 
eth now, saied Venus." So Udall, 
Diot replies (1588), p. n, ed. Arber. 



157. ropery] rascality; altered to 
roguery in F 4. The same change 
was made in Beaumont and Fletcher, 
The Chances, in. i., where the first 
folio reads : " You '11 leave this ropery 
When you come to my years." 
Steevens quotes The Three Ladies of 
London, 1 584 : ' ' Thou art very pleas- 
ant and full of thy roperye." O I 
has roperipe, which, as an adjective, 
meant ripe for hanging, lewd, un- 
gracious, and so appears in Minsheu's 
and Rider's Dictionaries. Compare 
rope-triiks in Taming of the ^/ii^-i 1 ,

Capulet's Orchard] Globe, Capulet's house Rowc, Capulet's garden Capell. 

So Barclay names R in his Ship of 
J-'ooIs. The word nr serves for the 
name of the letter (see A'ew Eng. 
/)/</.) and as a verb for to ^ro'vl ; so 
Na>h, Summer's J.ast //'///, 1600 : 
" They arre and bark at night against 
the moon. "' Th.ere is classical autho- 
rity ; that of Persius, and an allusion 
by Luciliiis. A pleasant illustration 
appears in Caret's Alvcarie, where 
through the loop of the large capital 
R. introducing the words beginning 
\\ith that letter, a standing dog peers 
out ; this design is peculiar to the 
letter R ; the letter, says Bard 
jocularly, is so necessary, " no man 
hath any colour to harke against 
it. . . . PerMus calleth R literam 
caninam." Milton, according to 
Aubrey, pronounced r very hard 
on which Dryden remarked, " litcra 
canina, the dog-letter, a certain sign 



of a satirical wit." Masson's Life of 
Milton, vi. 679. 

228,229. A' is for the No ;'] This 
conjecture of Ritson is happy ; but 
Theobald's reading "R is for thee ? 
No" may be right. While Romeo, 
however, addresses the Nurse as than, 
and the Nurse so addresses 1'etcr, she 
addresses Romeo &> you. 

231. sententious} I think the Nurse- 
means sentences m the sense of adages 
or maxims, as in JMcrchanl of Venice, 
I. ii. II : " (jood sentences and well 
pronounced." Possibly we should 
read sententious.

Ben. I pray thee, good Mercutio, let 's retire : 
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,

For now, these hot days, is the mad blood

Mer. Nay, an there were two such, we should have 
none shortly, for one would kill the other. 
Thou ! why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that 
hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard 
than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man 20

because thou hast hazel eyes ; what eye, but 
such an eye, would spy out such a quarrel? 
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is 
full of meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten 2 5 
as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast 
quarrelled with a man for coughing in the 
street, because he hath wakened thy dog that 
hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not 
fall out with a tailor for wearing his new 30 
doublet before Easter? with another, for 
tying his new shoes with old riband ? and yet

" God's bread, it makes me mad :

Perhaps Shakespeare intended that 
Capulet's madness should break the 
metrical regularity. A passage in 
the play Wily Beguiled, resembling 
this speech, is quoted by Malone ; 
but his statement that Nash in 1596 
alluded to this old play is probably 
an error ; the earliest existing edition 
is of 1606. Several hints for this 



speech were derived from Brooke's 
poem.

Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all, 
And all the better is it for the maid : 
Your part in her you could not keep from death ; 
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life. 70 

The most you sought was her promotion, 
For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced ; 
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced 
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself? 
O, in this love, you love your child so ill, 75 

That you run mad, seeing that she is well : 
She 's not well married that lives married long, 
But she 's best married that dies married young. 
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary 
On this fair corse ; and, as the custom is, 80 

In all her best array bear her to church ;

Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, etc. 

Rom. Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron. 
Hold, take this letter ; early in the morning 
See thou deliver it to my lord and father. 
Give me the light : upon thy life I charge thee, 2 5 
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof, 
And do not interrupt me in my course. 
Why I descend into this bed of death 
Is partly to behold my lady's face, 
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger 30 
A precious ring, a ring that I must use 
In dear employment : therefore hence, be gone : 
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry 
In what I farther shall intend to do, 
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint, 35 

And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs : 
The time and my intents are savage-wild, 
More fierce and more inexorable far 
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

Fri. I will be brief, for my short date of breath 
Is not so long as is a tedious tale. 
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet ; 230 
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife : 
I married hem ; and their stol'n marriage-day 
Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death 
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city ; 
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined. 235 
You, to remove that siege of grief from her, 
Betroth'd, and would have married her perforce, 
To County Paris : then comes she to me, 
And with wild looks bid me devise some mean 
To rid her from this second marriage, 240 

Or in my cell there would she kill herself. 
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art, 
A sleeping potion ; which so took effect 
As I intended, for it wrought on her 
The form of death : meantime I writ to Romeo 245 
That he should hither come as this dire night, 
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave, 
Being the time the potion's force should cease.

Return'd my letter back. Then, all alone, 

At the prefixed hour of her waking, 

Came I to take her from her kindred's vault, 

Meaning to keep her closely at my cell 

Till I conveniently could send to Romeo: 255 

But when I came, some minute ere the time 

Of her awakening, here untimely lay 

The noble Paris and true Romeo dead. 

She \vakes ; and I entreated her come forth 

And bear this work of heaven with patience : 260 

But then a noise did scare me from the tomb, 

And she, too desperate, would not go with me, 

But, as it seems, did violence on herself. 

All this I know ; and to the marriage 

Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this 265 

Miscarried by my fault, let my old life 

Be sacrificed some hour before his time 

Unto the rigour of severest law.

APPENDIX II 

ANALYSIS OF BROOKE'S "THE TRAGICALL HISTORYE 
OF ROMEUS AND lULIET," WITH QUOTATIONS 

VERONA described 1-12. 

The houses of Capelet and Montagew ; their strifes ; 
to allay which Prince Escalus uses first gentle means, and 
then sterner. (25-50.) 

Romeus, a beautiful youth, loves a fair maid, but she, 
being wise and virtuous, repels him. (51-72.) 

After many months of hopeless love, he desires to 
cure himself by travel ; yet cannot resolve upon it : 

He languisheth and melts avvaye, as snow against the 

sonne. 
His kyndred and alyes do wonder what he ayles. 

(73-100.) 

The trustiest of his friends rebukes him, and advises 
him to love a kinder mistress : 

Some one of bewty, favour, shape, and of so lovely 

porte : 

With so fast fixed eye, perhaps thou mayst beholde : 
That thou shalt quite forget thy love, and passions 

pastofolde. (101-140.) 

Romeus promises to attend feasts and banquets, and 
to view other beauties. (141-150.) 

Before three months pass, Christmas games begin, and 
Capel gives a banquet : 

No Lady, no knight in Verona 

But Capilet himselfe hath byd unto his feast : 
Or by his name in paper sent, appoynted as a geast. 
(151-164.) 

188 



APPENDIX II 189 

Romcus goes masked with other five; when they un- 
mask, he retires to a nook, but is recognised by the torches' 
light. (165-182.) 

The Capilets restrain their ire. (183-190.) 

Me views the ladies; sees one more beautiful than the 
rest ; and quite forgets his former love. Juliet's eyes 
anchor on him. Love shoots her with his bow. Their 
eyes inform them of mutual love. (191-244.) 

After a dance, Juliet finds Romeus seated by her : 

And on the other side there sat one cald Mercutio, 
A courtier that eche where was highly had in pryce : 
For he was coorteous of his speche, and pleasant of 

devise. 

Even as a Lyon would emong the lambes be bolde : 
Such was emong the bashful! maydes, Mercutio to 

beholdc. 
With frendly gripe he ccasd fayrc Juliets snowish 

hand : 
A gyft he had that nature gave him in his swathing 

band. 

That froscn mountayne yse was never halfe so cold 
As were his handes. 

The lovers' hands meet, palm to palm. Romeus cannot 
speak ; Juliet calls the time of his arrival blessed, and then 
is silent with love ; presently they are able to discourse, 
and Romeus declares his passion. (245-308.) 

Juliet, before leaving Romeus, confesses that (her 
honour saved) she is his. (309-318.) 

Romeus learns her name ; blames Fortune and Love ; 
but he now serves one who is not cruel. (319-340.) 

Juliet, inquiring first concerning others, learns from 
her old Nurse her lover's name : 

And tell me who is he with vysor in his hand 

That yender doth in masking weede besyde the 

window stand. 
His name is Romeus (said she) a Montegewe. 

Juliet inwardly despairs, but keeps up an outward 
show of gladness. She cannot sleep, and questions with 



190 APPENDIX II 

herself, May not Romeus be false? But treason cannot 
lurk in a shape so perfect. She will love him, if he mind 
to make her his lawful wedded wife, for the alliance may 
procure the houses' peace. (341-428.) 

Morning comes ; Romeus passes, and sees Juliet at 
her window; but is wary of danger. This happens often. 
He discovers a garden-plot fronting full upon her leaning 
place. Thither, when night has spread her black mantle, 
he goes armed ; but for a week or two in vain. One 
moonlight night Juliet leans within her window, and 
espies him. She rejoices even more than he, for she could 
not account for his absence by day. She is alarmed for 
his safety : 

Oh Romeus (of your lyfe) too lavas sure you are : 
That in this place, and at thys tyme to hasard it you 

dare. 
What if your dedly foes my kynsmen saw you here ? 

He answers that he can defend himself, and loves life 
only for her sake. Weeping, her head leaning on her arm, 
she tells her love, and promises that, if wedlock be his 
end and mark, she will follow him wherever he may go ; 
but if he intends her dishonour, let him cease his suit. 
Romeus rejoices, and says he will seek advice early 
tomorrow from Friar Lawrence. (429564.) 
The Friar is described : 

The barefoote fryer gyrt with cord his grayish weede, 
For he of Frauncis order was, a fryer as I reede. 

The secretes eke he knew in natures woorkes that 
loorke. 

Romeus, not staying till the morrow, goes to him. 
He advises delay, but, hoping to reconcile the houses 
by the marriage, is overcome. Romeus consents to the 
delay of a day and a night. (565-616.) 

Juliet's confidante is the ancient Nurse, who lies in her 
chamber, and whose aid she secures by promised hire. 
The Nurse eoes to Romeus : 



APPENDIX II i in 

On Satcrclay, quod he, if Juliet come to shrift, 
She shal be shrived and mariecl. 

She promises to devise an excuse for going, and talks of 
her babe Juliet : 

And how she gave her suckc in youth, she leavcth 

not to tell. 

A prety babe (quod she) it was when it was yong : 
Lord how it could full pretely have prated with it 

tong. 

Romcus gives her gold ; she returns, full of his praises : 

But of our marriage say at once, what aunswer have 

you brought? 

Nay soft, quoth she, I feare, your hurt by sodain ioye : 
I list not play quoth Juliet, although thou list to 

toye. (617-714.) 

On Saturday Juliet, the Nurse, and a maid, sent by 
Juliet's mother, go to the church. The Friar dismisses 
the Nurse and maid to hear " a mass or two." Romeus 
has already waited two hours in the Friar's cell : " Echc 
minute seemde an howre, and every howre a day." The 
lovers are married. Romeus bids Juliet send the Nurse 
to him for a ladder of cord. They think the day long; if 
they might have the sun bound to their will " Black shade 
of night and doubled darke should straight all over 
hyde." (715-826.) 

The hour arrives ; Romeus leaps the wall ; climbs 
the ladder. Bride and bridegroom embrace, and talk of 
their past and present state. The Nurse urges them to 
consummate their union. (827-918.) 

Dawn comes : " The hastines of Phoebus steeds in 
great despyte they blame." Their bliss lasts a month or 
twain. On Easter Monday Tibalt, a young Capilet, 
Juliet's uncle's son, "best exercisd in feates of armes," 
leads a street-fight against the Montagewes. Romeus seeks 
to part the combatants : " Not dread, but other waighty 
cause my hasty hand doth stay." Tybalt addresses him 
as "coward, traytor boy"; they fight; Tybalt is slain. 



192 APPENDIX II 

The Capilets demand Romeus' death ; the Montagewes 
remonstrate; the lookers-on blame Tybalt; the Prince 
pronounces exile as his sentence, and bids the households 
lay aside their bloody weapons. (919-1074.) 

Juliet weeps and tears her hair ; wails Tybalt's death ; 
curses her fatal window ; rails against Romeus ; and 
charges herself with murder for touching the honour of his 
name. The Nurse finds her seemingly dead upon her 
bed ; she revives ; breaks into lamentation ; is cheered by 
the Nurse with the hope of Romeus' recall from exile. 
The Nurse offers to go to Romeus, who lurks in the Friar's 
cell. Her mistress sends her forth. (1075-1256.) 

Romeus does not yet know his doom. The Friar 
goes forth, learns the sentence, and returns. He tells the 
Nurse that Romeus shall come at night to Juliet to devise 
of their affairs. He informs Romeus that the sentence is 
good, not death but banishment. Romeus is frantic, tears 
his hair, throws himself on the ground, and prays for 
death ; he blames nature, his time and place of birth, the 
stars, and Fortune. The Friar rebukes him : 

Art thou quoth he a man ? thy shape saith, so thou 

art: 
Thy crying and thy weping eyes denote a womans 

hart. 

So that I stoocle in doute this howre (at the least) 
If thou a man or woman wert, or els a brutish beast. 

He exhorts Romeus to fortitude ; he has slain his 
foe; he is not condemned to death; his friends may 
resort to him at Mantua. Romeus grows reasonable ; 
the Friar advises him as to how to quit Verona unknown ; 
and bids him visit cheerfully his lady's bower. (1257- 
1526.) 

Night comes; Romeus visits Juliet; he discourses of 
Fortune, and exhorts Juliet to patience ; she pleads to be 
permitted to accompany him in disguise ; he explains 
that they would be pursued and punished ; he hopes to 
procure his recall to Verona within four months ; if he 
does not, he will then carry her off to a foreign land. 



APPENDIX II 193 

Juliet submits, only requiring a promise that Romeus 
shall, through the Friar, keep her informed of his state. 
(1527-1700.) 

Light begins to appear in the East : " As yet he saw 
no day, ne could he call it night." Romeus and Juliet 
embrace and then part : 

Then hath these lovers clay an encle, their night 

begonne, 
For eche of them to other is as to the world the 

sunne. 

Romeus sets forth, clad as a merchant venturer, to Mantua. 
He states his grievance to the Duke ; he is overwhelmed 
with sorrow. (1701-1786.) 

Juliet pines and pales, though she endeavours to 
conceal her grief. Her mother notices the change in her ; 
tries to cheer her ; bids her forget Tibalt's death. Juliet 
declares that, a great while since, her last tears for Tybalt 
were shed. Her mother informs Capilet, and tells him of 
her suspicion that Juliet pines for envy of her married 
companions ; she urges Capilet to have her married. He 
replies that she is too young scarce sixteen years ; yet 
he will seek a husband. (1787-1874.) 

County Paris, an Earl's son, becomes a suitor. Her 
mother informs Juliet, commending "his youthfull yeres, 
his fayrenes, and his port, and semely grace." Juliet 
expresses amazement ; threatens to slay herself; kneels 
and implores. Old Capilet comes to her ; she grovels 
at his feet ; he charges her with unthankfulness and 
disobedience: 

thou playest in this case 
The dainty foole, and stubberne gyrle ; for want of 

skill 
Thou dost refuse thy offred weale, and disobey my 

will. 

Unless by Wednesday next she consents, he will dis- 
inherit and confine her. (1875-1996.) 

Next morning Juliet visits the Friar ; states her case ; 
threatens suicide, if marriage with Paris be otherwise un- 
avoidable. The Friar is in perplexity ; not five months 



194 APPENDIX II 

past, he had wedded her to Romeus ; the marriage with 
Paris is fixed for the tenth day of September. He tells 
Juliet of his youthful travels, in which he had learnt 
the virtues of stones, plants, metals. He explains the 
properties of the sleeping-powder ; exhorts her to courage ; 
bids her receive the " vyoll small," and on her marriage- 
day before the sun clears the sky, fill it with water : 

Then drinke it of, and thou shalt feele throughout 

eche vayne and lim 

A pleasant slumber slide, and quite dispred at length 
On all thy partes, from every part reve all thy kindly 

strength. 

Her kindred will suppose her dead ; will bear her to 
their forefathers' tomb ; the Friar will send to Mantua, 
and he and Romeus will take her forth that night. (1997- 
2172.) 

Juliet courageously agrees; passes with stately gait 
through the streets ; tells her mother that the Friar has 
made her another woman, and consents to marry Paris ; 
she will go to her closet to choose out the bravest 
garments and richest jewels. Old Capilet praises the 
Friar, and at once goes to inform Paris ; who visits Juliet, 
is charmed, and now only desires to haste the day. (2173- 
2276.) 

The bridal feast is prepared ; the dearest things are 
bought. In Juliet's chamber the Nurse praises Paris ten 
times more than she had praised Romeus : " Paris shall 
dwell there still, Romeus shall not retourne," or, if he do, 
Juliet shall have both husband and paramour. Juliet 
maintains a cheerful aspect ; sends away the Nurse, for 
she would spend the night in prayer ; then hides the viol 
under her bolster, and retires to bed. She doubts the 
unknown force of the powder. Will it work at all ? 
Serpents and venomous worms may lurk in the tomb. 
How shall she endure the stench of corpses? Will she 
not be stifled ? She thinks she sees Tybalt's dead body ; 
she is in a cold sweat ; fearing her own weakness, she 
swiftly drinks the mixture, then crosses her arms on her 
breast, and falls into a trance. (2277-2402.) 



APPENDIX II 105 

At sunrise the Nurse would wake her: "Lady you 
slepc to long, (the Earle) will rayse you by and by. ' 
She finds that Juliet is dead; the mother laments; the 
father, Paris, and a rout of gentlemen and ladies enter ; 
old Capilet has no power to weep or speak : 

If ever there hath been a lamentable day, 

A day, ruthfull, unfortunate and fatall, then I say 

this is that day. (2403-2472.) 

Meanwhile Friar Lawrence sends a friar of his house 
to Romeus with a letter, bidding him come "the next 
night after that," to take Juliet from the tomb. Friar 
John hies to Mantua ; seeks, according to custom, a 
companion brother, but, plague being in the house, is 
detained, and not knowing the contents of the letter, he 
defers till the morrow. All in Capilet's house is changed 
from marriage to funeral ; according to the Italian manner 
Juliet is borne to the tomb with open face and in wonted 
weed. Romeus' man, sent to Verona as a spy, sees the 
funeral, and bears tidings to his master. Thinking that 
his death would be more glorious if he died near Juliet, 
Romeus resolves to go to Verona. Me wanders through 
Mantua streets, sees an apothecary sitting outside his 
poor shop, furnished with few boxes, and bribes him with 
gold to sell poison, "speeding gere," contrary to the law. 
(2473-2588.) 

Romeus sends his man, Peter, to Verona, bidding him 
provide instruments to open the tomb. He calls for ink 
and paper, and writes an account of the events and his 
design, to be given to his father. At Verona Peter meets 
him with lantern and instruments. He orders Peter to 
leave him, and early in the morning to deliver the letter 
to his father. Romeus descends into the vault, finds 
Juliet dead, embraces her, and devours the poison. He 
addresses Juliet ; what more glorious tomb could he have 
craved ? He addresses the dead Tybalt ; prays to Christ 
for his grace ; throws himself on Juliet's body, and dies. 
(2589-2688.) 

Friar Lawrence comes to open the tomb, and is 
startled by the light in it. Peter explains to him that 



196 APPENDIX II 

his master is within ; the Friar enters and finds the body 
of Romeus. Juliet awakens ; the Friar shows her lover's 
corpse ; exhorts her to patience, and promises to place 
her in some religious house. She weeps, falls on Romeus' 
body, covers it with kisses, and laments her loss. Hearing 
a noise, the Friar and servant fly. Juliet, with a speech 
welcoming death, plunges Romeus' dagger in her heart. 
(2689-2792.) 

Watchmen, supposing that enchanters were abusing 
the dead, enter the tomb, find the corpses, arrest the 
Friar and Peter, and next day inform the Prince. (2793- 
2808.) 

Crowds visit the tomb. By the Prince's order the 
bodies are placed on a stage. Peter and Friar Lawrence 
are openly examined. The Friar in a long speech justifies 
himself, and explains all that had happened. His account 
is confirmed by Peter and by the letter of Romeus. Prince 
Escalus banishes the Nurse and lets Peter go free. The 
apothecary is hanged by the throat. The Friar retires to 
a hermitage and five years later dies, aged seventy-five 
(see line 2843). The bodies of the lovers are placed in a 
stately tomb, supported by great marble pillars : 

And even at this day the tombe is to be scene ; 
So that among the monumentes that in Verona been, 
There is no monument more worthy of the sight, 
Then is the tombe of Juliet and Romeus her knight. 
(2809-3020.)

RUNAWAY'S EVKS 
{Footnote to Page 100) 

AN editor has to consider whether the word runaway 
is to be retained ; and if it is, whether runaway s or 
runaways should be printed. The proposed substitutes 
are not happy ; among them are Rumour's, Renomy's, 
Luna's, unawares, rumourors', Cynthia's, enemies, rude 
day's (Dyce, ed. 2), sunny day's, sun-weary, and others 
of equal infelicity. The word runaway is strongly 
supported by the parallel (with variations) in ideas and 
language of Merchant of Venice, II. vi. 34-47. Jessica 
is on the balcony ; love, she says, is blind, and lovers 
cannot see their pretty follies. Lorenzo bids her " come 
at once, For the close night doth play the runaway" 
When Lorenzo speaks it is night; when Juliet speaks 
it is day, and she is gazing at the sun. 

I believe the genitive singular runaivays to be right. 
and I agree with Warburton that the sun or Phcebus is 
meant. It is objected that Juliet has complained of the 
slow pace of the sun ; but now she imagines night as 
having arrived, and the tardy sun has proved himself to 
be the runaway he actually was. 

I do not wish to innovate in the text, and I have left 
the commonly received punctuation. But a different 
punctuation might solve the difficulty. The word TJiat 
(before runaway's] may be the demonstrative pronoun, as in 
" That ' banished,' " line 113. " That runaway " ma}- mean 
"yonder runaway," or "that runaway (of whom I have 

197 



198 APPENDIX III 

spoken)." The central motive of the speech is " Come 
night, come Romeo." Having invoked night to spread 
the curtain, Juliet says, with a thought of her own joyful 
wakefulness, "Yonder sun may sleep" (wink having 
commonly this sense) ; and then she calls on Romeo 
to leap to her arms. 

I am not quite sure that " untalk'd of and unseen " is 
rightly connected with " Romeo." Possibly we should 
connect it with what follows. Lovers unseen seeing is in 
the manner of the play. This is a secondary question ; 
but perhaps the whole might be pointed thus : 

Spread thy close curtains love-performing night ! 
That [ = Yonder] runaway's eyes may wink and 

Romeo, 

Leap to these arms ! Untalk'd of and unseen, 
Lovers can see, etc. 

If following Delius we read runaways' eyes, the 
runaways (if not the stars) must be wanderers in the 
streets. Attempts have been made to produce an ex- 
ample of runaway in such a sense, but, I think, without 
success, and Professor Hales (Longman's Magazine, Feb. 
1892) has to admit that the word in this sense is a 
a^a^ 7.s~/6/j,ivov not only in Shakespeare, but in all English 
literature. Expressions of the desire of lovers for silence 
and the absence of babblers can of course be found, and 
Spenser's Epithalamium may be compared with Juliet's 
soliloquy, but the points in common are not, I think, 
such as prove more than that a community of subject 
suggested like ideas. 

Theobald read "That th' Runaway's" (after War- 
burton). Allen suggests the absorption of the by the 
final t in that. Commentators have named as the 
runaway the Night, the moon, Phaeton, Romeo, Juliet, 
etc. Halpin, with learning and ingenuity, argues 
that he is the runaway Cupid. See thirty closely 
printed pages on this line in Furness's Romeo and 
Juliet. 

White, who, after resisting it, came round to War- 



APPENDIX III 199 

burton's explanation, quotes from The Faithful Friends 
(Dycc, Beau, and Flet. vol. iv.) : 

The all-seeing sun, that makes fair virgins blush, 
But three short nights hath hid his peeping eyes ; 
Since that uniting Hymen tied our hearts, etc. 

So Mucedoms (noted by Professor Littledale), p. 35, 
ed. Delius : "The crystal eye of heaven shall not thrice 
wink" i.e. the sun shall not thrice set. 

I would ask the reader to consider my suggestion as 
to " That runaway's eyes " as offered with some degree 
of assurance ; but to observe that I throw out the notion 
of pointing "arms ! Untalk'd of" merely as a possibility, 
which ought not to be wholly lost sight of in studying 
the passage.
