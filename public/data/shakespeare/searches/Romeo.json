He accelerates the action, reducing the time from months to days, and thus adds impetuosity to the torrent of passion. He creates from a mere passing hint of Brooke the brilliant and gallant Mercutio. In Brooke's poem Mercutio appears but once for a moment, as a courtier in the ballroom of Capulet; he is \" courteous of his speech\" and \" pleasant of device\"; bold among the bashful maids as a lion among lambs; and nature has given him the gift of hands that are colder than frozen mountain ice.

Shakespeare, again, it is who introduces Tybalt at the old accustomed feast of Capulet, and thus, incarnating in an individual the rage of faction, brings hatred face to face with love. The character of the Nurse is found in Brooke, but Shakespeare admirably develops its humorous side. He reduces the age of Juliet from sixteen to fourteen, the age of Marlowe's Abigail, so heightening the miracle of love, which transforms her from a child to a heroic woman. Me deepens her solitude by depriving Lady Capulet of a mother's tenderness, and showing her as a somewhat unsympathetic woman of the world.

This form of the tragic scene was unknown to Shakespeare, who could have conveyed into it the beauty and dignity of passion ; when Otway, and subsequently Garrick, with Otway as his guide, varied from the Shakespearian close, they struck false notes and fell into the phrases of convention and pseudo- pathos.2","par":[{"boxes":[{"r":362,"b":733,"t":680,"page":29,"l":190}],"b":2019,"t":378,"page_width":1924,"r":1670,"l":170,"page_height":3122,"page":29}]},{"text":"Adrian Sevin's French transformation of the story of {{{Romeo}}} and Juliet into the story of Halquadrich and Burglipha (1542) has little interest, and does not take a place in the direct line of the development of the tale","par":[{"boxes":[{"r":371,"b":2170,"t":2116,"page":29,"l":200}],"b":2322,"t":2040,"page_width":1924,"r":1670,"l":170,"page_height":3122,"page":29}]},{"text":"from Da Porto to Shakespeare. Nor does there appear to be, except through a certain influence exercised on Bandello, any real connection between Shakespeare's tragedy and the poem in ottava rima published at Venice in 1553, possibly the work of Gherardo Bolderi assuming the name of Clitia or Clizia. It will be found in Torri's volume already mentioned. Mr. Daniel points out certain variations from Da Porto, of which the most interesting is that here for the first time Tebaldo's death is supposed by Lady Capulet to be the cause of Juliet's grief. An attempt was made by J. C. Walker, in his Historical Memoir on Italian Tragedy, 1799 (pp. 49-64), to show that Shakespeare had utilised to some extent as a source the Hadriana, a tragedy of the year 1578, by the blind poet Luigi Groto. The loves of Latino and Hadriana are unquestionably derived in part from the loves of Da Porto's {{{Romeo}}} and Giulietta ; but Mr. Daniel, who gives a complete analysis of the play, is right in saying that the resemblances between La Hadriana and Shakespeare's tragedy are rather to be sought in special passages than in the general conduct of the two plays. Following Walker and Lloyd, and adding to their enumeration, he notices the song of the nightingale when the lovers part, the description of the effects of the opiate, the consolation offered to the father on the supposed death of his daughter, and other seeming points of contact ; yet, although Groto was known in England in Shakespeare's time, Mr. Daniel's conclusion is expressed in the words: \" Notwithstanding these resemblances, I find it difficult to believe that Shakespeare could have made use of Groto's play\"   —a    conclusion   with    which    I    am    in    entire agreement.","par":[{"boxes":[{"r":926,"b":1639,"t":1588,"page":30,"l":754}],"b":2709,"t":374,"page_width":1924,"r":1734,"l":242,"page_height":3122,"page":30}]},{"text":"Bandello's novel, of which Boisteau's is a translation, stands of course in the direct line of the ancestry of Ronico and Juliet. It appeared among his novclle published at Lucca in 1554. Referring the reader to Mr. Daniel's more detailed account of the points in common between Bandello and Shakespeare, I may quote what I have elsewhere written : \" Bandello dwells on Romeo's amorous fancy for a hard-hearted mistress— Shakespeare's Rosaline—to which Da Porto only alludes. An elder friend—Shakespeare's Benvolio—advises the enamoured youth to ' examine other beauties,' and to subdue his passion. {{{Romeo}}} enters Capulet's mansion disguised, but no longer as a nymph. The Count of Lodrone is now first known as Paris. The ladder of ropes is now first mentioned. The sleeping potion is taken by Juliet, not in presence of her chamber-maid and aunt, but in solitude. Friar Lorenzo's messenger to Mantua fails to deliver the letter because he is detained in a house suspected of being stricken with plague. In particular we owe to Bandello the figure of the nurse, not Shakespeare's humorous creation, but a friendly old woman, who very willingly plays her part of go-between for the lovers. One more development and all the materials of Shakespeare's play are in full formation. From Bandello's mention of one Spolentino of Mantua, from whom {{{Romeo}}} procures the poison, Pierre Boisteau creates the episode of the Apothecary, and it is also to this French refashioner of the story that we must trace the Shakespearian close; with him, Juliet does not wake from her sleep until {{{Romeo}}} has ceased to breathe; and she dies, as in our tragedy, not in a paroxysm of grief, but by her own hand, armed with her husband's dagger.\" *•","par":[{"boxes":[{"r":947,"b":1404,"t":1350,"page":31,"l":774},{"r":677,"b":2467,"t":2413,"page":31,"l":505}],"b":2693,"t":518,"page_width":1924,"r":1666,"l":170,"page_height":3122,"page":31},{"boxes":[{"r":976,"b":426,"t":373,"page":32,"l":803}],"b":652,"t":373,"page_width":1924,"r":1746,"l":228,"page_height":3122,"page":32}]},{"text":"The Quartos and Folios do not divide {{{Romeo}}} and Juliet into acts and scenes.

It does not, however, appear in the list of the plays, and is thrust in between the Histories and the Tragedies, without any enumeration of the pages; except, I think, on one leaf only.\" To these hypotheses Knight replies, \" If these critics had carried their inquiries one step farther, they would have found that Troilus and Cressida was neither unknown nor forgotten by the editors of the first folio. It is more probable that they were only doubtful how to classify it. In the first quarto edition it is called a famous History in the title-page; but in the preface it is repeatedly mentioned as a Comedy. In the folio edition it bears the title of The Tragedie of Troilus and Cressida. In that edition the Tragedies begin with Coriolamis; and the paging goes on regularly from i to y6, that last page bringing us within a hundred lines of the close of {{{Romeo}}} and Juliet. We then skip pages Jj and 78, {{{Romeo}}} and Juliet concluding with 79. Now the leaf of Troilus and Cressida on which Farmer observed an enumeration of pages includes the second and third pages of the play, and those are marked 79, 80. If the last page of {{{Romeo}}} and Juliet had been marked yj, as it ought to have been, and the first page of Troilus 78, we should have seen at once that this Tragedy was intended by the editors to follow {{{Romeo}}} and Juliet.

In his Introduction to Shakespearian Study, published a year later, he merely says, \" This play was originally acted by the Chamberlain's men c. 1601, and was so entered for publication 7th February, 1603. . . .

The question naturally arises whether Shakespeare was the author of Richard III., or merely the editor and revi.ser of a sequel to those plays on which he had been engaged previously. Mr. Daniel holds that the play was really the work of the author or authors of the Henry VI. plays, and was revised by Shake.speare.    Mr. Fleay looks upon it as a Shakespearean recension but it has not that lyric fervour which give certain passages of Edward II. a. pathos that redeems their crudeness. It is con ceivable, in short, that Marlowe may have written much of Richard III.; but we have nothing from his hand which goes to prove that he must have had a part in it. It may be said that the style of the play is a distinct advance on the style of Titus Andronicus, which is closely akin to the style of Marlowe's most literal imitators. The individual quality of its rhetoric has been trained by previous work on the Henry VI. plays ; while probably the congeniality of a tragic figure like Richard to a taste founded on Marlowe's models has given an opportunity for the independent expression of that quality. Any tendency to exaggeration is softened by an increasing sense of the relation between the dramatist's art and life itself. If we allow Shakespeare to have had any part in the play, then Richard ///., whatever may be its debt to older material, shows witness of his hand, at a time when he has reached the stage of untrammelled expression of his meaning, but is still partly dependent on his models for the form that his work takes, and has yet to handle the highest gifts of poetry. The declamatory vigour of Richard III. gathers fresh life in the complaints of Constance and the ecstasies of {{{Romeo}}} and Juliet. Its echo is still audible in the balanced melody of the plays of Shakespeare's middle life. And, tame as it is in comparison, it is the first sign of tlie possibility of that eloquence, compact of fire and air, and pregnant with \"immortal longings,\" which is the case for the huge spirits of his great tragedies.","par":[{"boxes":[{"r":326,"b":1839,"t":1785,"page":22,"l":157}],"b":2184,"t":269,"page_width":1893,"r":1712,"l":134,"page_height":3072,"page":22}]},{"text":"(2) In date, then, Richard III probably follows immediately upon the third part oi Henry VI.
